  Bulbul is a Music Recommendation and Streaming Platform that uses graph algorithms to provide highly personalized music re commendationa and music discovery system. We have implemented a complete music streaming platform that enables users to listen 900K different music, create playlists, rate songs and get recommendations. Main feature is the music recommendation and discovery feature. We have collected a huge amount of data from Last.fm and Spotify to establish our database and we designed our algorithms onto these real life dataset. We have used Content Based Recommendation and Collaborative Filtering algorithms to give recommendations.
