It had also appeared on their album Good News for People Who Love Bad News.\n\nThe song was written by Dann Gallucci, Eric Judy, and Isaac Brock.\n\nAsked about the song in an interview with The A.V. Club, Isaac Brock said that he consciously intended to write something that felt more positive than some of his previous work.\n\nThe song was released on February 14, 2004 and was the first Modest Mouse song to gain mainstream popularity. Nearly a half year after its release, it became the band's first #1 hit on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. In Australia, the song was ranked #11 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004. In July 2009, it was also voted in at #94 in Triple J's Hottest 100 of All Time.\n\nNot only the song, but the music video, featuring computer animation styled after pop-up books, bears a degree of resemblance to the video of Franz Ferdinand's breakthrough single \"Take Me Out\", which is animated in a similar style, though with different aesthetics. Both songs became popular at around the same time.\n\nThis song was covered by Australian artist Ben Lee for the 2006 motion picture John Tucker Must Die, and again by indie band Goldspot for the sixth soundtrack of The OC, released on December 5, 2006.\n\nThis song is also featured in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's song \"Polkarama!\" on the album Straight Outta Lynwood.\n\nOn March 14, 2007 the song was used in a segment on American Idol that served as an advertisement for the Ford Motor Company. Idol producers later confirmed that the segment was actually based on the Kidz Bop cover of the song.\n\nThis song is featured in the 2009 movie \"Hit And Run\"\n\nThe song was also used as pro-snowboarder Travis Rice's profile song in the Absinthe Movies film \"POP\".\n\nIt is a playable track on Rock Band 2, Rock Band Unplugged, and Guitar Hero World Tour.\n\nThe introduction of the song is commonly used at the start of a segment on the Mitch Albom Show on WJR radio in Detroit.\n\nThis song was in heavy rotation at night on MTV/MTV2/VH1/Fuse upon music video creation/release. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Modest+Mouse/_/Float+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
