It was written and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis. Released as the album's lead single in the third quarter of 2001, it reached number one in 40 countries and has sold over four million copies worldwide. The song became Minogue's first U.S. top-ten single in thirteen years and is recognised as Minogue's signature song. According to the Can't Get You Out Of My Head Songfacts, it was the most-played tune of the 2000s in the UK, according to PRS for Music, which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and composers. In Kylie's biography the song's chart history is cited in describing it as Minogue's most successful hit to date.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\" was directed by Dawn Shadforth. It shows Minogue driving towards a futuristic city and back-up dancers in various futuristic costumes dancing in a highly stylized manner. It then focuses on Minogue in a sporty outfit, after which she is seen with other dancers in a computer-generated futuristic city. Her white, hooded costume, with plunging necklines and revealing slits, was widely discussed both for its fashion style and for Minogue's overt sexual posturing. Lastly, she appears with a curly hairdo in a metal-like costume. In his book La La La, William Baker conceded that the robotic dance within the video was purposely developed to give Minogue an association with a dance the way Madonna had developed an association with Vogueing, he felt that at this stage in her career it was important for Minogue to set trends and not follow them the way Madonna had before her.\n\nIn 2002, the video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography. It was voted the third best video of all time by viewers of MTV Italy. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/_/Can%27t+Get+You+Out+of+My+Head\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
