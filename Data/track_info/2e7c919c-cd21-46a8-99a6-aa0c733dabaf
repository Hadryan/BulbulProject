In 2004, the song was ranked #314 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nLyrics came from Roger Waters' experience when he was injected with tranquillizers for hepatitis by a doctor prior to playing a Pink Floyd show in Philadelphia on the band's 1977 tour for the Animals album.\nThis song features two guitar solos by David Gilmour, and is a particular favorite with Pink Floyd fans. The final solo is widely revered by fans worldwide as one of Gilmour's best, and is the archetypal rock guitar solo and it is frequently within the top of all guitar solo polls, such as a poll by listeners of digital radio station Planet Rock, in which it was named the best solo of all time. The guitar solo was chosen 4# on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\nAccording to the Comfortably Numb Songfacts, this was the last song Waters and Gilmour wrote together. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Comfortably+Numb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
