She died in her line of work when a tank collided into the side of a car she was riding on. The other important name in this song was Gerda's romantic interest, and colleague, Robert Capa. During the First Indochina War, Capa retreated from his Jeep in a hostile war zone to take pictures. He stepped on a landmine however, which blew apart his left leg. He was taken to a medical station where he died with his camera in his hand. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/alt-J/_/Taro\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Gerda Taro was a war photojournalist in the late 40's/early 50's.
