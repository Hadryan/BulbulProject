She explains her “father was sick and had cancer for six-and-a-half years” and adds “actually he was so sick for so long, it was good that he was out of pain. But I was actually holding his hand, which was like a long dream for me that I’d be with him. And so there’s a kind of feeling of peace when you find that your loved one is at peace. And so, yes, ‘Roses’ ‘ reflecting on that thing in life. You know what I mean? The circle of life and how when someone goes someone new comes in the door. Little babies are being born and all that stuff.”\nWhen asked if she’s expressing hope is Roses‘ refrain, she answers: “Oh, there’s definitely hope because everybody dies but with death comes spiritual peace and peace in your heart. It’s the end of any struggle that you might be having because we all get old and we all die but that’s a new beginning.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cranberries/_/Roses\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
