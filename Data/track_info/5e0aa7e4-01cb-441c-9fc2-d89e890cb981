The phrase \"Mamma Mia\" is an Italian saying that literally means \"My Mother\" and is used to express surprise.\n\nWhen released as a 45rpm single, In much of the world, the b-side was \"Intermezzo No. 1\", an instrumental mostly played by Benny & Bjorn. In the UK, the b-side was \"Tropical Loveland\", a more straight-foward pop song. The song made in the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, UK, Germany and several places, but peaked at #32 on the US charts. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/ABBA/_/Mamma+Mia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
