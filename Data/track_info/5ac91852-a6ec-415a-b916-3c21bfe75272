Perhaps the essential cut from an artist that just radiates quality. Essentially a song of three parts, the beginning draws you in with it's intimate guitar and vocal, the middle lifts you into the centre of a song that is profoundly soulful, and when you think it might be over, a superb bass riff leads you into a beautifully loose but fluid section that builds in intensity until, once again, you are brought back to the simplicity of the beginning. Wonderful music that will stay with you forever. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Callier/_/Dancing+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"From the 1973 album 'What colour is love'.
