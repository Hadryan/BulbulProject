English guitarist Eric Clapton with Cream popularized the song as \"Crossroads\" in the late 1960s. Their blues rock interpretation inspired many cover versions and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it as one of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". Rolling Stone placed it at number three on the magazine's list of the \"Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\" in recognition of Clapton's guitar work. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Johnson/_/Cross+Road+Blues\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
