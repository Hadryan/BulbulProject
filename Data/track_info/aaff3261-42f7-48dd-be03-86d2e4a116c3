It was during the first set of the March 10 show that Cream recorded \"Crossroads\". Arranged by guitarist Eric Clapton, the Cream version had a faster tempo than the original, and included two lines borrowed from Johnson's \"Traveling Riverside Blues.\"\n\nUnlike Cream's usual arrangement with bassist Jack Bruce singing, guitarist Eric Clapton took the vocals on this recording. Clapton's explosive guitar solos cemented his reputation as a guitar legend; his work from the track was named by one critic the greatest live rock solo ever. Bruce's fluid bass playing, blurring the line between rhythm and melody, has been similarly honored as the second-best live bass performance.\n\nIt was placed at #409 on the 2004 List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and #3 on the 2008 RS Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time lists. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/_/Crossroads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
