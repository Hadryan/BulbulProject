Club why he chose the title 'Neon Bible' for the album: \"I just jotted it down in my notebook and kept coming back to it. The song was very much off-the-cuff, written in one night and recorded the next day. Lyrically, there's a lot of stuff dealing with religion and culture, which I'm really interested in.

Some years later, his mother brought the manuscript of A Confederacy of Dunces to the attention of novelist Walker Percy, who managed to get the book into print. The novel attracted much attention in the literary world and in 1981, Toole was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. \n\nWin Butler first discovered Toole as a teenager whilst boarding at an exclusive school in New Hampshire. Neon Bible was later named after Toole's first book, which was published posthumously, after A Confederacy of Dunces had made him famous. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire/_/Neon+Bible\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
