It features on the compilation albums The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs, and originally appeared as the B-side to the boy with the thorn in his side. The song, one of the band's bleakest, features mostly piano; the melody was something Johnny Marr had been toying around with for years, originally composed (in simpler form) as a coda to suffer little children. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Asleep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Asleep\" was written by Johnny Marr and Morrissey, and recorded in London in 1985. It features on the compilation albums The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs, and originally appeared as the B-side to the boy with the thorn in his side. The song, one of the band's bleakest, features mostly piano; the melody was something Johnny Marr had been toying around with for years, originally composed (in simpler form) as a coda to suffer little children. The song was recorded the same day as rubber ring, when Marr announced that he had \"a little piano thing\" he wanted \"to put down with Morrissey.\"\n\nIt remains a fan-favourite, although it was only performed live once by the group (at Eden Court, Inverness, on 1 October 1985, the last date of the '85 Scotland tour), after a piano, which couldn't be moved, was discovered on the wings of the stage during the sound check. Morrissey was apparently in a fetal position in the center of the stage by the end of the song.\n\nThe song ends with a music box playing \"Auld Lang Syne\".\n\nIt has been covered by Stars and can be found on Sing Me to Sleep: Indie Lullabies. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Asleep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
