This soon propelled the single to mainstream success, reaching the #5 spot on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song starts off with harmonics played on the guitar along with the drums and bass. Though the song mainly has guitars with clean tones, distortion is used in the chorus.\n\nBlurry is about a breakup, and cowardice. The song was primarily written about how lead singer Wes Scantlin misses his son, Jordan.\n\nIt is best known for its refrain, from which it derived its secondary name: \"Can you take it all away? / Can you take it all away? / When you shoved it in my face / This pain you gave to me\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Puddle+of+Mudd/_/Blurry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
