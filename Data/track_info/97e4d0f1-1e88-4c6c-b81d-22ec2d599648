The song was released on June 7, 1999 by Jive Records, as the second single from the album. The teen pop song, speaks about a relationship where a girl is shy and does not express all of her feelings to her partner, despite wanting to.\n\n\"Sometimes\" received mixed reviews from music critics, with some calling it a further hit from ...Baby One More Time, but an entirely unremarkable song, while considering it an annoying representation of Spears' innocent years. It achieved commercial success, peaking inside the top ten on eleven countries. The song was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for selling over 70,000 physical units of the single. It was also certified Silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) in France, and Gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).\n\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, portrays Spears as the girl next door. Spears performed \"Sometimes\" on three world tours, including ...Baby One More Time Tour, where the singer performed a cover of \"Open Arms\" by Journey before it, Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, wearing an outfit similar to the one she wore in the music video of the song, and Dream Within a Dream Tour, where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant musical box as a ballerina to perform the song in a medley with and \"Lucky\" and \"Born to Make You Happy\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Sometimes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
