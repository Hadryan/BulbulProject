It was released as the album's first single in September 2007. This song was #32 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.[1]\n\nInstrumentation and lyrics\n\nLike the majority of songs that appear on White Chalk, \"When Under Ether\" was written and performed on the piano, which is a departure from prior PJ Harvey albums. It is also similar to the other tracks in that it is short in length and sung in a higher register than expected.\n\nMusically, the song is quite sparse, centering around Harvey's vocals — which have an airy, almost otherworldly quality to them — and a subtle, repetitive piano melody. According to critic Joshua Klein \"the simple repetitive pattern that gently drives 'When Under Ether' drips with menace.\"[3] Drums, autoharp, and organ accompany the main components of the song and are quite low in the mix.\n\nWhile the lyrics may indicate something as innocent as a dream dissolving into the clouds under diethyl ether intoxication, but while one critic takes the song as an account of a \"harrowing\" birth under archaic medical conditions[4], some critics[5][6] such as Heather Phares[7] hint that they \"quite possibly\" refer to \"abortion, since unwanted children are some of the many broken family ties that haunt the album\". However, when asked directly during an interview in the The Guardian, Harvey replied, \"That's obviously what you hear, but for me it's not actually tied to anything specific, like an abortion. These aren't just words. They're songs. They inhabit themselves, really\".[8] <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey/_/When+Under+Ether\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
