While credited to Lennon/McCartney, it was primarily written by John Lennon, though Paul McCartney contributed to the middle eight section. It is notable as the first example of a rock band actually playing the sitar in one of their songs; it was played by George Harrison. The song is a lilting acoustic ballad featuring Lennon's lead vocal and signature Beatles' harmonies in the middle eight. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Norwegian+Wood+(This+Bird+Has+Flown)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" is a song by The Beatles which first appeared on the 1965 album Rubber Soul.

It is notable as the first example of a rock band actually playing the sitar in one of their songs; it was played by George Harrison. The song is a lilting acoustic ballad featuring Lennon's lead vocal and signature Beatles' harmonies in the middle eight.\n\n\"Norwegian Wood\" was one of several songs on Rubber Soul in which the singer faces an antagonistic relationship with a woman. In direct contrast to earlier Beatles songs such as \"She Loves You\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", the songs on Rubber Soul were considerably darker in their outlook towards romantic relationships.\n\nThe exotic instrumentation and oblique lyric represented one of the first indications to fans of the expanding musical vocabulary and experimental approach that the group was rapidly adopting. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Norwegian+Wood+(This+Bird+Has+Flown)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
