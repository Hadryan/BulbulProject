Nigel Godrich, the producer of the album, thought that throwing the band into an \"uncomfortable\" situation would create an interesting atmosphere for the recording sessions, not unlike the OK Computer sessions that took place at the St. Catherine's Court mansion in Bath. The band lived in caravans surrounding the mansion while the recordings were taking place.\n\nYorke has described the song as \"a little bit like Neu! meets dodgy hippy rock.
