It was released as a promotional single in the U.S. and Canada only, whilst \"Universally Speaking\" was released in the UK. It peaked on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 13 in 2003.\n\nThe song features four guitars all playing completely different riffs. It is a ballad that clocks in at 5:11 making it the third longest recording on the album. It runs through stages, each time repeating the original verse until the song's completion. In between the verses, guitar solos can be heard from the four guitars that play. The first and third lines of the chorus are sung by John Frusciante, while the second and fourth are answered by Anthony Kiedis. Arguably, this piece is a closer reflection of Frusciante's solo albums, such as The Will to Death.\n\nUnfortunately, this song is impossible to be perfectly performed live by the Red Hot Chili Peppers due to the fact that John Frusciante dubbed the song so many times. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/_/Dosed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
