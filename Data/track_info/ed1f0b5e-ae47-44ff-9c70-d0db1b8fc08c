The song is a reference to the classic Audrey Hepburn movie of the same name, and is sung from the perspective of a young man faced with a potential break-up with his girlfriend. Desperate to find common ground, the singer can only think of a vague memory that they both like the film Breakfast at Tiffany's, and argues that the tenuous link between the lovers should serve as enough motivation for them to work out their problems and stay together as a couple.\n\nThe film Roman Holiday inspired the lyrics of the song but the author, Todd David Pipes, thought that one of Hepburn's other films would make a better song title.\n\nThe music video also sports some visual reference to the title itself as it features the band members arriving to a breakfast table and being served by butlers, beside the curb in front of Tiffany's in New York City.\n\nIn 1996, the song reached number five in the United States and number one in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe song is believed by many to be the only hit by Deep Blue Something and making many dismiss the band as a one-hit wonder.\n\nThe Movie\nBreakfast at Tiffany's is a 1961 American film starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard, and featuring Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam, and Mickey Rooney. It was directed by Blake Edwards. The portrayal of Holly Golightly as the naive, eccentric socialite is generally considered to be Audrey Hepburn's most memorable and identifiable role. She herself regarded it as one of her most challenging roles to play, as she was an introvert who had to play an extrovert. Hepburn's singing of \"Moon River\" helped garner an Oscar for Best Song for composer Henry Mancini and lyricist Johnny Mercer. The film also featured what was arguably George Peppard's greatest acting role and the high point of his career. The film is loosely based on the novella of the same name by Truman Capote. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Blue+Something/_/Breakfast+at+Tiffany%27s\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
