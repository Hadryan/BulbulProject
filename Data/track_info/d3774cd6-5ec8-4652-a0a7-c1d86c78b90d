It incorporates elements of the song \"Million Miles from Home\" by German techno band Dune.The song has been remixed by popular artist Celldweller and Australian electropop group Van She. It has received significant airplay on BBC Radio 1, being played frequently by DJ Zane Lowe.\n\nThe song was released exclusively for download on 12 April 2008 in Australia and New Zealand, where Pendulum were on tour at the time. It was later released globally for download on 21 April, and on physical formats on 28 April. The song reached number sixteen in the UK Singles Chart on 27 April based on downloads alone, and on 4 May the song peaked at number nine, making it Pendulum's biggest UK hit to date. It was also the official theme song of WWE Cyber Sunday 2008 as well as being used as background music for the official video highlights of the 2008 Belgian Grand Prix. It is also used as the runout song for Rotherham United football team.\n\n\"Propane Nightmares\" has received mixed reviews from music critics, mostly as a result of the change in style compared to older tracks produced by Pendulum. Some reviewers praised the new direction that the band had taken, for example Gerard McGarry wrote, in an article for Unreality Music, that Pendulum \"have created an epic song that - for our money - fuses their penchant for dance and rock music beautifully\". Jo-Ann Greene of Allmusic described the song as \"another sizzling single\" in her review of In Silico, while Fiona McGlynn wrote that \"...Propane Nightmares is a fresh take on a merge of genres that actually works\", in her single review for the Manchester Evening News.\n\nThe track also received some criticism, mostly derived from Pendulum's migration from drum and bass to a more rock-imbued sound. In his review for AngryApe, Tim Johnson pointed out that \"the problem... lies in Pendulum trying to cram too much into one space... almost like two or three different songs being played on top of one another\". Simon Catling went further, writing an open letter in the webzine God Is In The TV to Pendulum asking them to \"decide whether [they] wish to be a band or a drum nâ€™ bass act\" and commenting that \"at the moment all [they're] providing us with is a horribly half-baked and shoddy form of neither\".\n\nOn 22 July 2008, it was announced that \"Propane Nightmares\" had been nominated for Best Single at the Kerrang! Awards 2008 ceremony, alongside singles from four other rock bands. The ceremony was held on 21 August, and Pendulum lost to 30 Seconds to Mars who took Best Single with their song \"From Yesterday\".\n\nA music video was also produced themed around a religious cult closely resembling Heaven's Gate, in particular depicting the mass suicide of members of a cult by poison after first drinking citric juices. Several scenes of Pendulum performing before the cult are intercut in the middle of the video, which otherwise focuses primarily on two members who attempt to flee during the cult suicide.\n\nThe video was originally uploaded to the band's YouTube channel as early as 27 March 2008 to help promote the single. It was later released for download in May, most notably through the digital media delivery service Xbox Live, which allowed all users to download the video freely. It was also included on the special edition and iTunes bonus tracks versions of In Silico, the album from which the song was originally taken.\n\n\"Propane Nightmares\" entered the UK Singles Chart on 27 April 2008 at number sixteen based on downloads alone, already making it Pendulum's biggest hit to date. After the release of physical formats during the following week, the song peaked at number nine on 4 May, becoming their first and only UK Top 10 single to date. It also entered the Billboard European Hot 100 chart, peaking on 17 May at number 32 and remaining in the chart for a total of ten weeks. \"Propane Nightmares\" was also the band's first charting single in the United States, reaching number 38 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in December 2008. It was also featured on Now 70, the only one of the band's songs to be featured in a Now! album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pendulum/_/Propane+Nightmares\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
