It was the second single released from his album Play. This was also the second single charting at #33 on the UK Singles Chart. Two versions of the CD were released. The first, with a red cover featuring a vertically-aligned mousetrap, featured two remixes of \"Run On\" and two other tracks. The second, with a yellow cover featuring a horizontally-aligned mousetrap, contained four different \"Run On\" remixes.\n\n\"Run On\" is a traditional folk song which also known as \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\". Mobys remix version features vocals fromBill Landford & the Landfordaires song Run for a Long Time. The lyrics are a warning to sinners that no matter how hard they try, they will not avoid God's judgement; in the chorus, God Himself tells the narrator of the song to:\n \"Go tell that long tongue liar, \ngo and tell that midnight rider, \ntell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter, \ntell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down\"\nwith some versions inserting slight variations in lyrics.\n\nThe song has, in the past, been modified to fit the boundaries of genres like country, folk, gospel and techno. As \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\", it was performed by Odetta God's Gonna Cut You Down on Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues (1956) and Johnny Cash on the posthumously released American V: A Hundred Highways (2006). As \"Run On\", it was recorded, among others, by Elvis Presley.  The Blind Boys of Alabama  also included Run On For A Long Time on their Grammy-winning album \"Spirit of the Century\" in 2001.\n\nThe vocal content of the song comes from a 1943 recording of \"Run On\" by Bill Landford and the Landfordaires, and features music, a mix of house music and instrumental music.\n\nLyrics:\n\nLord God Almighty let me tell the news,\nmy head got wet in midnight dew.\nGreat God i been down on my bended knees,\ntalking to a man from galilee.\nMichael spoke and he sound so sweet,\nI thought i heard the shuffle of angels' feet.\nHe put one hand upon my head,\ngreat God Almighty let me tell you what He said.\n\n[bridge:]\n\nGo tell that lonesome liar,\ngo tell that midnight rider, \ntell the gamblin', ramblin' backslider,\ntell them God Almighty gonna cut 'em down.\n\n[chorus:]\n\nYou might run on for a long time,\nrun on, dunkin' and dodgin',\nrun on, children, for a long time,\nlet me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down.\n\nYou might throw your rock, hide your hand,\nwork in the dark with your fellow men,\nsure as God made you rich and poor,\nyou're gonna reap just what you sow.\n\n[chorus] x3\n\nYou might run on for a long time,\nrun on, dunkin' and dodgin',\nrun on, children, for a long time,\nlet me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down.\n\nSome people go to church just to signify,\ntrying to make a date with a neighbor's wife.\nBrother let me tell you just as sure as you're born,\nyou better leave that woman alone.\n\n[bridge]\n\n[chorus] x8 <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Moby/_/Run+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
