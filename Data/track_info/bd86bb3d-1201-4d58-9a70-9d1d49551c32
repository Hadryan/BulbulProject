He prefers to leave lyric interpretations to the listener.\n\nThis song got Young in trouble with his wife. He had to explain that the Cinnamon Girl was just a person he came across while touring.\n\nYoung recorded this with his band Crazy Horse.\n\nThis was originally released on the album in 1969. Young put out an alternate version as a single in 1970, which did well partly because he was getting exposure as a member of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Cinnamon+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Young has never said who the Cinnamon Girl is.

This song was also covered by Smashing Pumpkins on the Reel Sessions bootleg. Cinnamon Girl was also covered by the band Killdozer on their 1985 album \"Snake Boy\".\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Cinnamon+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
