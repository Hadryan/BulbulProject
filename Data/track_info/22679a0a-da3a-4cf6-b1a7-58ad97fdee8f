It also showed its longevity when it reached #48 as a re-entry in 2005.\nThe version featured in the original album is nearly nine minutes long and contained some bells ringing at the start, usually unknown to clubbers, who were used to listening to the Monster Remix of the song. It also was ignored by radios due to its explicit lyrics.\nMaxi Jazz, the vocalist of the song, sings as an insomniac, attempting to sleep (\"I toss and I turn without cease, like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast/At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers, but now I keep myself pepped\").\nThis is a very popular subject amongst dance music fans, as use of drugs/stimulants is deeply rooted in club/rave culture, thus making insomnia a common side-effect.\nFaithless have also expressed their annoyance at German DJ/producer Sash!, to whom they have addressed accuses of plagiarism, having reused elements of the song for his single \"Encore Une Fois\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Faithless/_/Insomnia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
