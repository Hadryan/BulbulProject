The song title was revealed through Vogue magazine. \"Judas\" was the second single from the album. The song was registered on Gaga's BMI on March 18, 2011. Gaga announced via Twitter that she will announce the release date during the 41st Transmission Gagavision on Tuesday, April 5, 2011. She officially anounced that Judas would be released on the Easter Week, April 19th, exactly 4 days before Judas betray Jesus Christ, however, the song was released 4 days earlier than scheduled due to leaks.\nGaga  planned to do 3 teasers in 3 days until April 19th but all planned was aborted.\n\nThe meaning for the song is described as a woman in love with a man who betrays her.\nHowever, during interview with Google, she also mentioned that  \"It's about leaving your darkness behind in order to come into the light, I have a lot of things that have haunted me from my past - choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances - and Judas represents, for me, something that is bad for me that I can't escape. I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am.\" \n\nAnd Eric Henderson from Slant was saying in his review that to read her Biblical parable as a simple endorsement of the Holy Gospel is simplistic, and misses the central point: that Gaga's heart belongs to the Good Book's bad guys. In entangling herself with the legacy of the man who, depending on how you look at it, either condemned God's incarnation to agonizing death or set into motion the apparatus that redeemed all of humanity, Gaga's self-described \"holy fool\" flips one of the Christian right's most arrogantly passive-aggressive catchphrases: The chorus of \"Judas\" may as well be \"Love the sinner, love the sin.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Judas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
