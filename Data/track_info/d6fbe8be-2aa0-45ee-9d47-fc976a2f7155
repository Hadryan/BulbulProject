She was 16 and she had leukaemia, and her friend reached out to us and asked if we would go to the hospital and sing her a song, so we did … we went there.\n\n    It was a really beautiful experience but really intense. Her family was there in the room with us as well, in this really intimate space. It felt like, one, we were walking into this world that we didn’t know, and two, it was tragic because she was dying and it felt like we didn’t belong there. It felt like we were intruding upon the family’s really personal, last moments with their daughter, and we were all really awkward, but then we had been asked to be there, and we were her favourite band, so we went and sung her a song.\n\n    She was kind of in a coma and she wasn’t awake, but she woke up while we were there and I remember sitting on the bed with her and she didn’t really have … her central nervous system was shutting down and she didn’t really have the motor skills … but she was definitely moving around like she knew that we were there, and she was excited — or as excited as she could be in that state — and we just kept waving to her, saying ‘Hi, hi!’\n\n    Her name was Haley, Haley Butcher, and we were waving to her, trying to get her to notice that we were there. Theresa went home that day and wrote a song about that experience and it’s called Hi.”\n\n    - Jenny Lee Lindberg \n\nhttp://www.ripitup.com.au/music/article/warpaint-interview-2014\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Warpaint/_/Hi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
