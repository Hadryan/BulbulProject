Smith. He says, \"[The riff] came from nowhere. The strange thing was, I knew immediately these chords were important in some way... When Neilly [[artist]Neil Primrose, the band's drummer] arrived I played the chords and he played along and instantly played the pattern. It is the best drum line Neilly has ever done... Dougie, [[artist]Dougie Payne, bassist] then picked up the bass line like he'd been practising it all week... There isn't a bit of fat on the song. Every note, every beat, is perfect.\" He also adds that Paul McCartney and Luke Pritchard both complimented the song when they first heard it. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis/_/J.+Smith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
