Martin told Rolling Stone that lyrics about a fox becoming a god and a \"carnival of idiots on show\" were a commentary on Fox News.\n\nChris, Jonny, Guy & Will scored their 9th UK top ten hit in May 2008 with the Brian Eno produced 'Violet Hill'. Not long after, in mid-June, their latest album 'Viva La Vida' shot straight to No.1 on both sides of the Atlantic and downloads of the title track gave them their first chart-topping single here in Britain. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Violet+Hill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
