That's really beautiful.\"\n\nThe single was actually released before the album in March 1990, 19 months before the arrival of the album in October 1991 and was around 3 minutes shorter than the album version.\n\n\"Loaded\" reached #16 on the UK singles chart and featured a remix from regular Weatherall collaborator Terry Farley.\n\nMuzik magazine listed the song as one of the 50 most influential dance records of all time, describing it as \"unquestionably the finest indie dance record ever... something akin to \"Sympathy For The Devil\" for the E generation\"\n\nThe song appeared in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.\n\nIt was also used in the fourth installment of VH1's The Drug Years. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Primal+Scream/_/Loaded\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
