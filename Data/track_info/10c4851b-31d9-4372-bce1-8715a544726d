It was the group's second number-one hit on the U.S. charts (the first being 1981's \"Keep on Loving You\", also written by Kevin Cronin) and reached number sixteen in the UK. \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" has appeared on dozens of 'various artists' compilation albums, as well as several REO Speedwagon greatest hits albums. It has also been featured on soundtracks of movies such as Not Another Teen Movie, Waiting..., and, most recently, Kickin' It Old Skool and Sex Drive. The song was also heard on the South Park episode \"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\", the Fringe episode \"Power Hungry\" as well as in the Showtime hit series Queer as Folk. REO Speedwagon performed the song at the 1985 Live Aid concert and it was sung at the end of Horton Hears a Who!.\n\nIt was referred to again recently in The CW show Supernatural (in the second season episode #5, \"Simon Said\", Jo Harvelle turns this song on for Dean Winchester in Harvelle's Roadhouse, later he sings it in the car claiming the song had stuck in his head). It was also featured prominently in advertising for the film Horton Hears a Who!, and sung by the major characters near the end of the movie as the titular character celebrates his vindication and his charges' salvation. It was also used in a Valentine's Day 2009 commercial for Hallmark Cards, and was sung in the hit show Glee. It was again featured in an early episode of King of the Hill when Dale marries Nancy.\n\nTwo different music videos exist for the song. One is a basic video, appearing almost homemade, featuring the band in the studio. It begins with Kevin Cronin playing the piano, attempting to find the key in which he can best sing the song (starting off in G major, he later decides he can sing it better in A). After Cronin exchanges some laughs with his bandmates, the song officially begins; the video essentially consists of the band members lip-synching to the original track of the song. It then concludes with Cronin uttering the memorable line, \"That warmed the cockles of my cockles!\" The other version of the video is much more \"professional,\" and makes various references to the life-cycle. Both videos have been shown at various times on VH1 Classic.\n\nMost recently, the song featured in a Muller Fruit Corner advertising campaign \"Thank You Cows\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/REO+Speedwagon/_/Can%27t+Fight+This+Feeling\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
