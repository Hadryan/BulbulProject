The song peaked at #8 on the charts of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1971. On Cash Box the single peaked at #3. Billboard co-listed the b-side \"Hey Tonight\". Some have speculated that the song's lyrics are referencing the Vietnam War, with the 'rain' being a metaphor for bombs falling from the sky. In his review of the song for Allmusic website, Mark Deming suggests that the song is about the idealism of the 1960s fading in the wake of events such as the Altamont Free Concert and the Kent State shootings and that Fogerty is saying that the same issues of the '60s still existed in the 1970s but that people were no longer fighting for them. However, Fogerty himself has said in interviews and prior to playing the song in concert that the song is about rising tension within CCR and the imminent departure of his brother Tom from the band.\n\nJohn Fogerty released a live version of the song on his The Long Road Home - In Concert DVD which was recorded at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, California on September 15, 2005.\n\nIn The Media:\n\n    * A version of the song,sung by JuJu Stulbach, rearranged and produced by Friesbie's P.T.
