You're doing anything, thinking, 'Oh God, maybe if I put a cork up myself, maybe it'll keep this little life in.' That's why in 'Spark', I say, 'She's convinced she could hold back a glacier/But she couldn't keep baby alive.' You just start going insane. There's nothing you can do, so so you surrender and then... start again.”\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tori+Amos/_/Spark\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
