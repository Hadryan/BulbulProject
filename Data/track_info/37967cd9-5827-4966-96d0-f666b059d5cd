The song is propelled by Mani's recognisable bass line, John Squire's droning guitars and Ian Brown's hushed ominous vocals, repeating only a few lines of lyrics throughout the entire song.\n\nThe song was first performed live in 1985, during the earliest Stone Roses gigs. It was originally played much faster than its current form. It wasn't until 1987 that the song became the designated concert opener. It would remain at the top of their concert setlists until the Stone Roses disbanded in 1996. The song \"I Wanna Be Adored\" appears in the movie Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). It is also used in the movie Green Street.\n\nIn May 2007, NME magazine placed \"I Wanna Be Adored\" at number 17 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.\n\nIan Brown would later perform B-side \"Where Angels Play\" live from 2004, and a new version was included on the b-side of his single, \"Time Is My Everything\". In 2002, the music magazine Q voted it 32nd in its list of 100 greatest songs of all time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/_/I+Wanna+Be+Adored\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
