It is the fifth song and lead single from the band's ninth studio album, Murder Ballads (1996), released on Mute Records. It was written by the band's frontman Nick Cave and produced by Tony Cohen and Victor Van Vugt.\n\nThe song received a positive reception from music critics and became the band's most successful single worldwide reaching No. 3 in Norway, the top five in Australia, and the top twenty in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and New Zealand. It also received a limited promotional release in the United States. The song was certified Gold in Germany in 1996 for 250,000 copies sold, despite never reaching the top ten in that country. It charted again at the bottom of the German Top 100 in 2008 because of digital downloads after it was used in a soap opera. \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\" was also certified Gold in Australia for selling 50,000 copies.\n\nCave was inspired to write \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\" after listening to the traditional song, \"Down in the Willow Garden\", a tale of a man courting a woman and killing her while they are out together. Cave arranged this tale as second of two B-sides, \"The Ballad of Robert Moore & Betty Coltrane\" / \"The Willow Garden\", released on the CD-Maxi single version.\n\nAlthough the song does not feature on a Minogue studio album, it can be found on her compilations Hits+, Greatest Hits 1987â€“1999, Ultimate Kylie and The Abbey Road Sessions. Minogue performed a chorus of the song during her Showgirl and Homecoming tours.\n\nIt reached number 8 in Triple J's Hottest 100 1995. In 2012, NME listed the song in the \"100 Best Songs of the 1990s\" at number 35. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Cave+&+The+Bad+Seeds/_/Where+the+Wild+Roses+Grow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
