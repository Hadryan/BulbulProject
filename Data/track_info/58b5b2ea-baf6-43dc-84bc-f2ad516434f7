The video was filmed in Dorset, a county in south-west England, and features scenes shot at Wareham railway station, the region around St. Aldhelm's Head, and the twelfth century St. Aldhelm's Chapel. The scene in which the soldier dies was shot at Bovington Camp, where Blunt had been stationed during his service in the British Army; soldiers from the camp participated in the filming. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/James+Blunt/_/Carry+You+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
