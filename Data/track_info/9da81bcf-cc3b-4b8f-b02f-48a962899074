The single peaked at #1 in New Zealand for 4 consecutive weeks, and at #2 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was never released in North America or Asia.\nAccording to Jackson - when he was interviewed by Oprah  - the video from Give In To Me was shot in just about 2 hours in Germany in late August 1992. The pyrotechnics appearing on the video are computer generated and were added later on.\nThe single release is notable for its B-sides, which include the album versions of \"Dirty Diana\" and \"Beat It\", two songs which also include guest appearances by rock guitarists (Steve Stevens and Eddie Van Halen, respectively). The remix of the song which was just recently made features J-Bo of the rap group YoungBloodz.. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Give+in+to+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
