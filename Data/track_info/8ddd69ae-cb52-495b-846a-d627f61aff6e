Johnny Marr sang and played it in a Later With Jools Holland TV broadcast (June 2013).\nThe lyrics describe the protagonist's frustration of being hounded by others for his comments, to which he replies \"I was only joking\".\nDuring the song, the protagonist compares himself to Joan of Arc as the flames rose to her Roman nose.[2] The proceeding line, \"and her Walkman started to melt'\", is often changed by Morrissey in live performances, to the more technologically-current \"and her iPod started to melt\".[3]\nThe high-pitched voice in the background is actually Morrissey's voice altered to a higher pitch. The backing vocal is credited to \"Ann Coates\", a reference to the Manchester district of Ancoats. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Bigmouth+Strikes+Again\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
