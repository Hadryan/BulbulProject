The car heard being driven in the song was the bass player's (Doug Stegmeyer) 1960s Corvette. According to Joel, Anthony isn't a real person, but rather \"every Irish, Polish, and Italian kid trying to make a living in the U.S.\". The song originally appeared on Joel's 1977 album, The Stranger. \n\nRhythmic and soothing, nice instrumental portions and clean vocals. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/Movin%27+Out+(Anthony%27s+Song)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
