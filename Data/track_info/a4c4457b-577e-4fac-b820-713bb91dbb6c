During an appearance on Shade 45's morning show the rapper explained that despite not knowing why he was removed, he's cool about it. Said Drake: \"We make music differently. I make what comes to me and I hate changing it, whereas 'Ye will change something 30 or 40 times to get it perfect. To each their own, and the change was to put all those people on it, and I wasn't one of them. That's completely OK.\"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/All+of+the+Lights\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
