Having a song included in the book has been described \"the ultimate insider credential for a jazz composer\".\n\nThe song is used as instrumental background music on the BBC London radio programme presented by Danny Baker. It was also the theme tune for the early 1970s BBC2 show \"One man's week\".\n\nA cover of the piece recorded by Zappa Plays Zappa (including Zappa's son Dweezil and former Zappa alumni Steve Vai and Napoleon Murphy Brock) won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in February 2009. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa/_/Peaches+en+Regalia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
