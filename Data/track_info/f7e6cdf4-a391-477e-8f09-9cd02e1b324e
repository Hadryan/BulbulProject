By way of introduction to a live performance, Mann has referred to this song as \"the song that lost an Oscar to Phil Collins and his cartoon monkey love song.\"\n\nIt is one of her most popular and best-known recordings, and has become a fan favorite.\n\nThe music video, shot shortly after the filming of Magnolia, was directed by the film's director, Paul Thomas Anderson, and uses many of the film's actors including Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Tom Cruise. The video inserts Mann into various scenes from the film as she performs the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Aimee+Mann/_/Save+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
