Despite this fact, it has been covered by many artists from the 1970's through to 2001. Ramsey Lewis was the first to cover it, and it has been included on many of his compilation albums Indeed, Riperton performs with Lewis on his December 26, 1970 live recording of the song at Chicago's famed London House. \n\nIn 2001 4hero with Carina Andersson as the lead vocalist covered the track and it was this version that later featured in a TV advert for Baileys Irish Cream. Additionally, this cover has also recently been used in an advertisement for a BBC TV wildlife documentary, and a video by Sony Entertainment entitled 'The Future Of Gaming'. \n\nOther perhaps less notable artists who have covered/sampled the track include Kenneth Bager, in his track Fragment Seven \"Les Fleurs\" feat. Julee Cruise. \"Les Fleurs\" has also been sampled by Jurassic 5 on \"Thin Line\", Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf on \"Apple Juice Break,\" Gang Starr on \"Jazz Music\", Black Sheep on \"Similak Child\", and by the East Bay hardcore band, Please Inform the Captain This Is a Hijack, on \"Robot Rampage in a Luxury World.\" This sampling and reuse is testament to the 'fresh sounding' original track. \n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/4hero/_/Les+Fleur\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
