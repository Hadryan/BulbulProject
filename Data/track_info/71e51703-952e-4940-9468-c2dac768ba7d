The track was written by the duo, and produced by George Martin for McCartney's fifth solo album, Pipes of Peace (1983). The song was the pair's second duet to be released, following \"The Girl Is Mine\" for Jackson's Thriller (1982), however, it had been recorded one year before, at the same time as McCartney's Tug of War (1982) album. The single became Jackson's seventh top ten hit in a year upon its release in October 1983. \"Say Say Say\" was a number one hit in the US and peaked at number two in the UK. Number one in Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway and Sweden, the single also peaked within the top ten in Australia, Austria and New Zealand.\n\nCertified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, the song was promoted with a music video directed by Bob Giraldi. The video, filmed in Santa Ynez Valley, California, featured cameo appearances by Linda McCartney, and La Toya Jackson. The short film centered around two con artists, \"Mac and Jack\", and introduced dialogue and storylines to music videos. Upon its release, the video was considered too violent by the National Coalition on Television Violence. \"Say Say Say\" was covered by the Dutch music group Hi-Tack in early 2006. They took the song to number four on the UK singles chart.\nRecording\nPrior to the release of \"Say Say Say\", McCartney had collaborated with Jackson on \"The Girl Is Mine\", for Jackson's Thriller album. In return, Jackson agreed to include \"Say Say Say\" on McCartney's Pipes of Peace.[1] The song was recorded at Abbey Road Studios from May to September 1981. During this time, McCartney was also recording Tug of War, his first solo album since splitting from Wings.[2] Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening whilst at the dining table, McCartney brought out a booklet displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. \"This is the way to make big money\", the musician told Jackson. \"Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid\". McCartney's words later influenced Jackson's purchase of the Northern Songs song catalogue in 1985.[3] The recording of \"Say Say Say\" was completed in February 1983. George Martin, who had worked with The Beatles, produced \"Say Say Say\". He said of Jackson, \"He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's no question about it. He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is...but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas\".[2] Upon Jackson's death in June 2009, McCartney commented on his time working with the singer. \"I feel privileged to have hung out and worked with Michael. He was a massively talented boy man with a gentle soul. His music will be remembered forever and my memories of our time together will be happy ones.\"[4]\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson+&+Paul+McCartney/_/Say+Say+Say\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
