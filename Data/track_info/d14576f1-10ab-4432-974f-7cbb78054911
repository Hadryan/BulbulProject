The song has three verses about three different times if his life living in the Wisconsin town. He told Mojo: \"The title is a metaphor for when you're not doing well. But it's also a song about redemption and realizing that you're worth something; that you're special and not special at the same time.\"\nThis was released as the second single from Bon Iver on September 5, 2011. It was backed by a cover of Peter Gabriel's \"Come Talk To Me,\" which was originally released in April 2011 as a limited-edition 7-inch for Record Store Day.\nBon Iver hired the Australian visual artist Nabil Elderkin for the song's music video. Elderkin has also worked with Kanye West, Frank Ocean and Common. He filmed the visual among Iceland's glacial landscapes, which features a young boy traveling through the rocky, picturesque landscapes. The clip was fittingly debuted on the National Geographic website. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Iver/_/Holocene\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
