This is combined with footage of Todd Roper playing in the streets, Victor Damiani playing on top of a car, and Greg Brown playing in a crowded courtyard. The runner from the video for \"The Distance\" is seen running by in the background of one scene [02:01].\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cake/_/I+Will+Survive\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
