Also included – and recorded at the same session – was a cover version of a Cilla Black song, Work Is a Four-Letter Word. Morrissey's insistence on recording this song incurred the wrath of Johnny Marr who left the band not long afterwards.\n\nThe single itself is a tongue-in-cheek, music hall inflected song that clocks in at a mere two minutes and two seconds. Although seemingly lightweight and catchy, the song features acidic, ambiguous lyrics. The song also contains peak guitar work by Johnny Marr. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Girlfriend+in+a+Coma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
