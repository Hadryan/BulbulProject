However, the lyrics also contain references to Hogarth's own youth, notably when he was publicly humiliated by his games teacher.\nAt 17:57, the song is Marillion's longest track to date, topping even \"Grendel\". It goes through many tempo and key changes, but the main chorus returns at the end. Due to its complexity, it is rarely played live. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marillion/_/Ocean+Cloud\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
