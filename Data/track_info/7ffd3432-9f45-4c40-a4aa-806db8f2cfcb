Rolling Stone praised lead singer Phil Lynott's \"Gaelic soul\" and called the \"twin-guitar lead by Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson\" used \"crucial to the song's success\". The song is played at most Irish Rugby matches. In March 2005, Q magazine placed \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" at number 38 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thin+Lizzy/_/The+Boys+Are+Back+in+Town\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
