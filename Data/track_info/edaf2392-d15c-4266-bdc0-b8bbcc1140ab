The constant background vocal during the chorus saying \"What the fuck was that?,\" which even appears in the lyrics in the CD booklet, was never edited. This is possibly due to the fact that the background vocal appears incoherently, and most people dismiss it as undecipherable lyrics. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/EMF/_/Unbelievable\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
