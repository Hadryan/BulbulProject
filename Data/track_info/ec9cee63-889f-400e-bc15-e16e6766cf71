A studio-recorded acoustic version appeared as a bonus track on the 2007 reissue of Ghosts of the Great Highway, and a live acoustic version appeared on Kozelek's  Little Drummer Boy in 2006.\n\nThe song Pancho Villa, also on GotGH, has essentially identical lyrics, and is performed with a full band, but with the heavily distorted electric guitar replaced with an acoustic.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sun+Kil+Moon/_/Salvador+Sanchez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
