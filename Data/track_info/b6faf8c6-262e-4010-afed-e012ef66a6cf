The song is about child abuse and how a person seeks to heal themselves after being abused when young. Similarly, the lyrics deal with a person breaking the chain of hatred/abuse and not mistreating their own loved ones the way they themselves were mistreated. It has never been played live. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Fixxxer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Fixxxer\" is the 13th track from metal band Metallica's seventh studio album Reload.
