The track is from the Battlestar Galactica Season 3 soundtrack. \n\nThis melody has a major significance to the plot of the show as it recurs at key points, giving characters clues to their objectives and ultimately linking entire civilisations. The track is well suited to this purpose, beginning with an ancient and mystical feel merging with progressive heavy riffs, orchestral depth and unconventional-sounding guitar solos. It is not recognisable as a cover of the original Bob Dylan song until the vocals are heard.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bear+McCreary/_/All+Along+the+Watchtower\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
