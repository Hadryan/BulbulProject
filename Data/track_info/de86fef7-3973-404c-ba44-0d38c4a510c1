Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaría released the tune as a latin pop single the next year on Battle Records, where it became a surprise hit, reaching #10 on the pop charts. Santamaría's recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. Hancock radically re-worked the tune, combining elements of funk, for the album Head Hunters (1973).\n\n---\n\nThis track is taken from Cantaloupe Island and is not the funky version from Headhunters. It is a very simple number with only 3 chords in it, which makes for some really laid back soloing. Unusually for jazz of the time, the piano plays a funky riff which continues throughout, except of course where Herbie needs both hands for his own solo! It is a milestone piece from one of the world's most influential jazzers. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock/_/Watermelon+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
