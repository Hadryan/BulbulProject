It was released on vinyl in February 1970 by Elektra/Asylum Records and produced by Paul Rothchild. It has a fairly short running time of 2:50 and blends seamlessly into the next track on the album, \"Blue Sunday\", making it easy for radio stations to play the two songs consecutively.

It was released on vinyl in February 1970 by Elektra/Asylum Records and produced by Paul Rothchild. It has a fairly short running time of 2:50 and blends seamlessly into the next track on the album, \"Blue Sunday\", making it easy for radio stations to play the two songs consecutively. The lyrics were adapted from a couple of Morrison's poems, one being entitled \"Abortion Stories\".\n\nThe hook of the song is a distorted G5 chord played three times by guitarist Robby Krieger, followed by a brief percussive Wah-wah effect. Morrison begins nearly every line with the word blood, often referring to \"Blood in the streets... blood everywhere...\". A brief musical interlude is next, followed by a guitar solo, and a spoken word verse (\"Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding...\"). The song ends with a final chord as it segues into the next track, \"Blue Sunday\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Doors/_/Peace+Frog\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
