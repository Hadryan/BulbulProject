Strummer was disappointed and disillusioned that these performances had been more \"pop\" and \"lightweight\" similar to Ken Boothe's brand of reggae with Four Tops-like dance routines, and that the acts had been \"performances\" rather than the roots rock rebellion that he had been hoping for.\n\nThe song then moves away from the disappointing concert to address various other themes, nearly all relating to the state of Britain at the time. First giving an anti-violence message, then addressing the state of 'wealth distribution' in Britain, promoting unity between the Black and White youths of the country before moving on to address the state of the British punk rock scene in 1978 which was becoming more mainstream.\n\nIncluded is a jibe at an unnamed group who wear Burton suits, taken by many to be The Jam (though in an NME article of the time, Strummer claimed the actual target was the power pop fad hyped by journalists as the next big thing in 1978) and the lyric concludes that the new groups are in it solely to be famous and for the money.\n\nThe final lines fret over the social decline of Britain, noting sardonically that things were getting to the point where even Adolf Hitler could expect to be sent a limousine in the unlikely event of flying into London.\n\nThe single was reissued in June 1978 with a different cover art.\n\nThis song was one of Joe Strummer's favorites, he continued to play it live with his new band The Mescaleros until his death and it was played at his funeral.\n\nCritical reception\n\n\"(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais\" helped The Clash assert themselves as a more versatile band musically and politically than many of their peers, and it broke the exciting but limiting punk mould that had been established by the Sex Pistols; from now on The Clash would be \"the thinking man's yobs\".\nRobert Christgau recommended the single for \"(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais\" in his Consumer Guide, published by Village Voice, on 4 September 1978, and described the song as a must. Denise Sullivan of Allmusic wrote that \"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\" may have actually been the first song to merge punk and reggae.\"\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone rated the song as #430 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash/_/(White+Man)+in+Hammersmith+Palais\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
