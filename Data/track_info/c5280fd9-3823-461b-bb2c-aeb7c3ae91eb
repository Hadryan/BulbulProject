David had nobody, he split to live with my Dad and we didn't see much of each other for a good 6 or 7 years. That song was about the time we were apart, and like 'Rooster' was my dad, it was a way of trying to build a bridge.\" The song appeared on Alice in Chains MTV Unplugged album, and Jerry Cantrell played this at Dimebag Darrell's tribute, at his house the night he died. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains/_/Brother\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
