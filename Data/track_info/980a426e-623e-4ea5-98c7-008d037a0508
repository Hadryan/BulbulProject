It was released as the third and final single from the group's 1997 album OK Computer. Accompanied by a music video that featured a single shot of singer Thom Yorke's head in a plastic bubble that filled with water, the single peaked at number four in the United Kingdom.\n\nRadiohead wrote \"No Surprises\" while touring with the band R.E.M. in 1995. \"No Surprises\" was the first song Radiohead recorded on the first day of recording sessions for OK Computer. The version of the song on the album is the first take recorded. Singer Thom Yorke commented, \"We did endless versions afterwards [...] and they were all just covers of the first version. So we gave up and went back to [the original].\"\n\nThe lyrics originally told the story of a man who has become fed up with the way things are working out for him and is having problems with his girlfriend. Two lines from this version are, \"He was sick of her excuses / To not take off her dress when bleedin' in the bathroom.\" Preparing to record the song, Yorke altered the lyrics dramatically; instead of telling a love story about a man and his girlfriend, the song now appears to figuratively reference taking one's own life (as evidenced in lyrics such as \"I'll take a quiet life/A handshake/Of carbon monoxide\") to illustrate contempt for the complacency of British \"normality\".\n\n\"No Surprises\" was released as the third single from OK Computer on 12 January 1998. The single reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe music video for \"No Surprises\" was directed by Grant Gee. The video consists solely of a single close-up shot of Thom Yorke's head inside a clear plastic bubble. The lyrics to the song scroll backwards on the bottom of the screen throughout the video. After the first verse, the plastic helmet begins to fill with water. Yorke continues singing as he attempts to lift his head above the rising water. Once the bubble completely fills, Yorke is motionless for over a minute, after which the water is released and he resumes singing. For Yorke's safety, the video was filmed at high-speed and played back in slow-motion.\n\nRecently \"No Surprises\" were present in House open 6th. season episode that shows Hugh Laurie's character suffering to drop the vicodin dependence. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/No+Surprises\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
