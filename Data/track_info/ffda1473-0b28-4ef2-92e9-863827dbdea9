Written by lead singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes, the song was rumored to have been originally intended for Tina Turner. It was recently listed 87th on VH1's 100 Greatest Love Songs and 10th on their list of Greatest Power Ballads.\n\nThe song became one of the biggest hits in 1987, and it further defined Whitesnake as one of the premiere rock groups of the 1980s. It reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart and number 2 in the US singles chart, making it their second-biggest US hit after Here I Go Again which hit number 1. This is a rare occurrence of the original heavier track charted higher than the power ballad.\n\nThe single was reissued in 1994 on cd and cassette, with the songs \"Sweet Lady Luck\" and \"Now You're Gone\" as b-sides. This version reached No.25 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe music video featured David Coverdale's future wife Tawny Kitaen, who had appeared in the band's earlier video for \"Here I Go Again\".\n\nThe Audio Thieves featuring Uniting Nations covered this song in their 2006 album Dance Cover. Also in 2006 Thomas Anders covered the song for his album Songs Forever. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Whitesnake/_/Is+This+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
