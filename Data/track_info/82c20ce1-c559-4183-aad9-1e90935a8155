The original recording was released as a single in 1969 and reached #4 in the UK charts. \n\nThe lyrics are written from the perspective of a pinball champion, called \"Local Lad\" in the Tommy libretto book, astounded by the skills of the opera's eponymous main character, Tommy Walker: \"That deaf, dumb, blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\", and \"I thought I was the hobby table king, but I just handed my pinball crown to him.\"\n\nTownshend once called it \"the most clumsy piece of writing [he'd] ever done\"; nevertheless, the song was a gigantic commercial success and one of the most recognized tunes from the opera. It was a perpetual concert favourite for Who fans due to its pop sound and familiarity. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who/_/Pinball+Wizard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
