His work combined Marxism and psychoanalysis to advocate sexual freedom. In the 1930s, Reich came up with the concept of \"orgone,\" a physical energy contained in the atmosphere and in all living matter. The \"Cloudbuster\" was a device he came up with to manipulate the orgone energy in the atmosphere, which would force clouds to form and bring rain.\n\nHawkwind and Patti Smith have both released songs about Reich's concept of Cloudbusting.\n\nDonald Sutherland appears in the video as the inventor/father. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/_/Cloudbusting\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
