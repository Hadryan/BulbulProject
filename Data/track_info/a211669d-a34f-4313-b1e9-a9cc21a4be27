The lyrics, describing the singer's anxieties about his relationship with his girl while he is away, are thematically similar to several other Lennon/McCartney songs, such as \"When I Get Home\" and \"Things We Said Today,\" written during the period of 1964 and 1965. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Wait\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Wait\" is a song recorded by The Beatles, from their 1965 album Rubber Soul.

The vocals on the verse are shared between Lennon and McCartney, and McCartney sings the two middle eight sections.\n\nOrigin:\n\nThe song was originally recorded for Help! in June 1965 but did not make the final pressing. When Rubber Soul fell one song short for a Christmas release, \"Wait\" was brought back. The Beatles added overdubs to the initial recording so it would blend in better with the other, more recent songs on Rubber Soul.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJohn Lennon – vocals, rhythm guitar\nPaul McCartney – vocals, bass\nGeorge Harrison – guitar\nRingo Starr – drums, maracas, tambourine\nPersonnel per The Beatles Bible\n\nCover versions:\n\nA cover version was issued as a single by Frankie Vaughan but failed to chart.\nA cover by husband and wife duo Sam Lakeman and Cara Dillon was included on the 2006 compilation Rubber Folk.\nSupergroup Yellow Matter Custard also covered the song.\nBen Kweller did a cover of the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Wait\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
