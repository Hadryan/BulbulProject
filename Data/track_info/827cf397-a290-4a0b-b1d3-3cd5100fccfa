It was the first single and music video from their second full-length album, Ænima. Due to its name and perceived subject, the song had its lyrics altered and its title changed by TV and radio programmers, who also shortened the track.\n\n-Interpretation-\nDuring an interview, Keenan stated that the song is titled after a friend of drummer Danny Carey who \"isn't afraid of getting his hands dirty.\" He also stated that it can be interpreted as being about \"fist-fucking\" but \"if  you really look at it and really look at us and who we are, you'll understand that we go a little deeper than some write-off song about fist-fucking.\" Fist fucking is in actuality a metaphor for the real cause of ailment.\n\nKeenan would introduce the song during the Ænima tour as \"about choosing compassion over fear.\"\n\n-Music video-\nThe music video for \"Stinkfist\" was created with stop-motion animation techniques, and was directed by the band's guitarist Adam Jones (who had previous experience in art direction and animation). It focuses on a race of sand people who suck on tubes and swallow nails and wires that apparently hurt them and are ejected from their bodies, after which they are put in jars and treasured. Another race of mutants has entrails that are plugged into a wall. At least one reviewer compared the visuals to the works of H. R. Giger.\n\nThe video achieved heavy rotation on MTV, although it was shown only with the title \"Track #1\" instead of \"Stinkfist\". MTV reasoned that \"Stinkfist\" is too offensive for public consumption. Matt Pinfield, the host of 120 Minutes, responded on air to the lot of email complaints from fans by saying there was nothing he could do about it. While he said \"if you don't know the name of the song, go out and buy the album!\" he was waving his fist in front of his face. When introducing the video, VJ Kennedy would also sniff her clenched fist dramatically before saying \"Track #1\". The video has been placed at number 6 in a recent feature on Scuzz of viewer's top 50 music videos of all time, and number 1 in its list of the \"Top 10 Most F*ckedUp Videos\".\n\n-Live Performance-\nThroughout 2001–2002, the band played an extended version of the song, adding lyrics from \"Suspicious Minds\" from Elvis Presley. Maynard sings, \"Caught in a trap, Can't walk out. Because I need you too much baby. Why can't you see, what you're doing to me? Because you love me too much baby.\" Since 2001 the band has extended the song when played live with an additional breakdown and guitar solo. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/Stinkfist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
