Written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \"Alive\" originated as an instrumental titled \"Dollar Short\" and was included on a demo tape circulated in hopes of finding a singer for the group. Vocalist Eddie Vedder obtained a copy of the tape and wrote lyrics that describe a true account of the time when he was told that the man he thought was his father was not actually his biological parent. It's guitar solo is ranked 44 on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\n\"Alive\" charted at number 16 in the UK (the single was available only through import in the US). A remixed version of the song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991â€“2003). Although the song was not a huge hit upon its release (peaking at number 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart), it has endured as a fan favorite and a staple of rock radio since then, as well as one of the most requested songs at the band's concerts.\n\n\"Alive\" features an extended guitar solo after its third chorus (3:38), which is likely one reason it's a favorite of so many fans. The solo for \"Alive\", performed by McCready, was ranked number 44 on Guitar World's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\", and number 26 on Total Guitar's list of the \"100 Hottest Guitar Solos\". Interestingly, when interviewed about his famous solo, McCready was quick to disclaim creative credit for it, saying he basically \"copied Ace Frehley's solo from 'She', which was copied from Robby Krieger's solo in The Doors' 'Five to One'.\" Aside from that influence, it strongly highlights the influences of Jimi Hendrix on McCready's playing, including extensive wah pedal use, frequent whammy bar dips and vibrato, as well as the use of a battered Stratocaster guitar.\n\nGuitarist Stone Gossard wrote the music for the song, which he titled \"Dollar Short\", in 1990 when he was still a member of Mother Love Bone. According to Gossard in an interview for Pearl Jam's VH1 Storytellers special, Mother Love Bone frontman Andrew Wood had even sang on it. After Wood died of a heroin overdose, Gossard and his bandmate Jeff Ament started playing with guitarist Mike McCready with the hope of starting a new band. \"Dollar Short\" was one of five tracks compiled onto a tape called Stone Gossard Demos '91 that Gossard, Ament, and McCready circulated in the hopes of finding a singer and drummer for the group.\n\nThe tape made its way into the hands of vocalist Eddie Vedder, who was working as a gas station attendant in San Diego, California at the time. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. \"Alive\" was the first song for which Vedder recorded vocals. Vedder mailed the tape back to Seattle. Upon hearing the tape, the band invited Vedder to come to Seattle and he was asked to join the band.\n\nThe band, then called Mookie Blaylock, recorded \"Alive\" during a demo session at London Bridge studio in January 1991. The version recorded during this session would later appear on the group's debut album, Ten, and on the promotional \"Alive\" EP. During album mixing sessions in England in June 1991, mixer Tim Palmer had McCready add to the song's outro solo. McCready recorded a number of attempts at the solo, and Palmer edited them into a composite version. The guitarist was unsatisfied with the result, so he made another attempt at the solo. \"He had another go at it\", Palmer recalled, \"and got it right away. There was no piecing together to do; it was one take.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/_/Alive\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
