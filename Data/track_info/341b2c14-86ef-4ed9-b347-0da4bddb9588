It's sometimes said  to be one of the most widely sampled tracks ever.  \n\nThe instrumental textures and effects processing to this groove were very unusual at the time it was released in 1981 and have remained fresh and widely used and copied in the 28+ years since it was recorded. It has recirculated on dusty groove DJ sample records and long been a favorite of live DJs. Copies of the original vinyl  12\" EP this is on typically sell for about $50 on Ebay and are rare.\n\nIt uses some of Martin Hannett's trademark sound with reverb and processing - offhand I think it's heavy on a flanger and chorus with lots of feedback overloading the the signal as it pulses. \n\nSome artists sampling this:\n\n    * sampled by Public Enemy on Night of the Living Baseheads (1988)\n    * sampled by Big Daddy Kane on Ain't No Half Steppin' (1988)\n    * sampled by Stezo on It's My Turn (1989)\n    * sampled by Tim Dog on Fuck Compton (1991)\n    * sampled by Liars on Tumbling Walls Buried Me in the Debris With ESG (2001)\n    * sampled by J Dilla on Geek Down (2006)\n    * sampled by Miles Davis on Fantasy (1992)\n\nMartin's wet reverby production was first heard widely on his work with Joy Division and A Certain Ratio and became a recognizable early 80's post punk/new wave sound heard on many releases on Factory Records and spawning many copycats - much of the 4AD records catalog circa 1981-84 has a similar feel - but nothing really comes close to the groove that these funky chicks hit after Hannett's entourage fell in love with their sound and produced their six song EP. The song is  arguably more as much Hannett's as it is ESG.\n\nIf you like what you hear here then check out related artists like  ACR (A Certain Ratio) especially To Each, Sextet, and I'd Like to See you again and the early 12\" EPs they did. Maximum Joy, Liquid Liquid, Basement 5 and Glaxo Babies might also come a little close. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/ESG/_/UFO\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
