Byrne would recall: \"I had always loved [the] song [\"Always Something There to Remind Me\"], so we called a friend who had the record, he read the lyric over the phone and we put it together from memory.\"\n\nOn the strength of the demos cut in Bristol Byrne and Fisher were signed to EMI Records in May 1982 and the track \"Always Something There to Remind Me\" was cut 1 September 1982 in a session at Abbey Road Studios produced by Tony Mansfield. Byrne would recall: \"The record was recorded at Abbey Road, and we were invited to a party downstairs, with Paul McCartney and many other stars...When we returned upstairs to the studio around 1 a.m., I decided to have a go at the vocal, It was the first time I have ever recorded a vocal in one take\".[3]\n\nReleased in the US in January 1983, Naked Eyes' \"Always Something There to Remind Me\" gradually gained attention entering the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1983 to peak at #8 that June. The cachet of entering the US Top Ten allowed the single, previously overlooked in its performer's UK homeland , to make a July 1983 UK chart debut but only to rise no higher than #59. \"Always Something There to Remind Me\" did afford Naked Eyes Top Ten success in Australia (#7), Canada (#9) and New Zealand (#2).[4]\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Naked+Eyes/_/Always+Something+There+To+Remind+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
