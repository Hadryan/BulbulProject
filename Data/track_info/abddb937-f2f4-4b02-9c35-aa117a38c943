This precursor contained the first lick to the song \"Europa\". It was put away and not touched for some time.\n\nWhen Santana was touring with Earth, Wind & Fire in Manchester, England, he played this song again, this time with Tom Coster who helped him with some of the chords and thus Europa was born. \nIt was renamed to \"Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Santana/_/Europa+(Earth%27s+Cry+Heaven%27s+Smile)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
