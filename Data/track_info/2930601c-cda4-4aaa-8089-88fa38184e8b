The magazine Rolling Stone ranked the song as number 230 in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time[1]\n\nDylan wrote this ballad on Thanksgiving Day 1965 while touring in Kansas City. It was allegedly inspired by New York socialite Edie Sedgwick, who frequented Andy Warhol's Factory at around the same time Dylan was introduced to Warhol and had a tendency to catch the attention of musicians (The Velvet Underground's Lou Reed wrote \"Femme Fatale\" about Sedgwick at about the same time, released on 1967's The Velvet Underground & Nico).\n\n\"Just Like A Woman\" has also been rumored to be written about Dylan's relationship with fellow folk singer Joan Baez.[citation needed]\n\nSome women's groups criticized this because of its disparaging lyrics.[citation needed]\n\nDylan played the song at George Harrison and Ravi Shankar's Concert for Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nThis song was not released as a single in the UK. Manfred Mann's version hit #10 there in 1966. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Just+Like+a+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
