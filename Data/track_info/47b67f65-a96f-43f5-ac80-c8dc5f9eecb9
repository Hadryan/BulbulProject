The understanding from the book was that the \"ego death\" experienced under the influence of LSD and other psychedelic drugs is essentially similar to the dying process and requires similar guidance.\n\nPeter Brown claimed that Lennon's only source of inspiration for the song came from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which he says Lennon read whilst consuming LSD.  George Harrison later stated that the idea for the lyrics came from Leary, Alpert, and Metzner's book.  McCartney confirmed this by stating that he and Lennon once visited the newly opened Indica bookshop—as Lennon was looking for a copy of The Portable Nietzsche—and Lennon found a copy of The Psychedelic Experience, which quoted the lines: \"When in doubt, relax, turn off your mind, float downstream\".  Lennon bought the book, went home, took LSD, and followed the instructions exactly as stated in the book. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Tomorrow+Never+Knows\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
