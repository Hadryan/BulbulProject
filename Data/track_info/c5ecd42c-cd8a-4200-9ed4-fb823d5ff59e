The song reached the top 40 twice prior to the Darin version (Goodman-1948, Williams-1955).\n\n\n Performances by Darin\n\nDarin's recording has been used in many films, TV shows and video games, including Apollo 13, Austin Powers in Goldmember, Diner, Goodfellas, Lost, Black Rain, The X-Files, The Adventures of Ford Fairlaine and BioShock. The song was also played in a 2005 commercial for Carnival Cruise Lines. A portion of Bobby Darin's recording was played during the splashdown and post-recovery of Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 in the first episode of the 1998 HBO miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon.\n\nPerformances as Darin\n\nKevin Spacey sang the song in the movie Beyond the Sea, a biopic about Bobby Darin, \nin a \"fantasy\" sequence leading up to his marriage to Sandra Dee. Similarly, on the television series American Dreams, Duncan Sheik performed the song while playing the role of Bobby Darin.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Darin/_/Beyond+the+Sea\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
