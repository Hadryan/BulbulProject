Limp Bizkit were surrounded in a steel fence/cage in which audience members climbed up and jumped off.\n\nThe music video for My Generation shows Limp Bizkit performing live on an acrylic glass stage (probably a reference to the line, \"the sun don't even shine through our windowpane\"), while other scenes show their fans being rebellious. During the breakdown of the song, each band member is shown separately, disappearing and reappearing.\n\nProfessional wrestler Travis Tomko who worked as a bodyguard for the band at the time makes an appearance in the video pulling Fred Durst out of the crowd. The hard rock/metal band Staind also performed on this very same stage in the video for their single Mudshovel.\n\nThe word \"Generation\" sung with a stutter resembling the one in The Who's song, My Generation. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit/_/My+Generation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
