I felt no compunction about doing it because I was using the Stars on 45 version of the song. I was ripping off the rip off. So I left this part where you can barely hear the cowbell in the break. The best part, I think, is the bassline, though. I work to get really empty basslines, and \"Miura\" is probably the emptiest one I've ever done. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metro+Area/_/Miura\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"It's no secret that the beat to \"Miura\" is basically a cover of \"Funky Town.\" I was using a kick and a snare, and I thought it would be nice to put a little reference in.

The best part, I think, is the bassline, though. I work to get really empty basslines, and \"Miura\" is probably the emptiest one I've ever done. It's just two of the same note in the verse. I really enjoy when there's no virtuosity involved, but it still comes across as expressive.\n\nWe finished the record as we usually did at Darshan's place, who had a real studio in a loft in Manhattan right under Sonic Youth at Murray Street. It sounded like God was vacuuming upstairs when they were working, it was so loud. It was there that we recorded the vocals of Dei Lewison, who was actually the daughter of Woody Cunningham, the drummer of Kleeer. It was completely accidental, but we were so excited to be working with someone related to this disco guy. Something felt really right about having her work on it with us. \n\nIt's a bit hard to talk about \"Miura,\" because it's a track that came together in my bedroom. I think that's common to all bedroom producers. I'm thankful, of course, that it got big. It was the biggest record on the label. But, like any big record, we also grew to resent it. When we would DJ and people would ask us to play it, I'd think, \"That's really nice...but it's going to sound exactly the same as when you play it at home.\"\nâ€“ Morgan Geist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metro+Area/_/Miura\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
