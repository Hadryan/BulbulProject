It also reached number two in the UK Singles Chart, where the group had had success before its American breakthrough. Though they had made a few European charts before, this brought the band to their first mainstream success in the United States. Extreme followed \"More Than Words\" with another power ballad, \"Hole Hearted,\" which was slightly faster paced than \"More Than Words\", but nevertheless topped at number 4 in the United States and number 3 in Canada.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Extreme/_/More+Than+Words\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
