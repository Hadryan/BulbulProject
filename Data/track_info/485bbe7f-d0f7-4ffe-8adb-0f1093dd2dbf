The bass line drowns out the \"me.\"\n\nOne of the most covered songs of all time, cover versions of \"Come Together\" have been recorded/performed by many artists -- such as Aerosmith, Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Gotthard, Soundgarden, Axl Rose & Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Diana Ross, Tom Jones, Joe Cocker and Sugababes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Come+Together\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
