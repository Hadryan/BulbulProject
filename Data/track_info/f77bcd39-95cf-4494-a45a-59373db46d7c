The Jungle Boogie Songfacts reports that Boyce's vocals on the hit were so popular he was invited to sing back-up and perform \"vocal effects\" on a number of Kool & The Gang singles, including \"Spirit of the Boogie,\" \"Open Sesame,\" and \"Slick Superchick.\" Boyce performed with the band from 1973 to 1977. An instrumental version of the tune with an overdubbed flute part and additional percussion instruments titled \"Jungle Jazz\" appeared on the album Spirit of the Boogie.\n\n\"Jungle Boogie\" has been repeatedly sampled in e.g., EPMD's 1988 album Strictly Business, The Beastie Boys' 1989 release \"Hey Ladies\", Madonna's 1992 top ten hit \"Erotica\", Janet Jackson's 1994 top ten single \"You Want This\" and M/A/R/R/S' \"Pump Up the Volume\" in 1987. 24/7 Spyz has covered this song on their first album, Harder than You. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kool+&+The+Gang/_/Jungle+Boogie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
