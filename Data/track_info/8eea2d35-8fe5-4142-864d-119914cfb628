The single's B-side contains \"Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men\", where lead singer Julian Casablancas duets with Regina Spektor. The official release date was delayed slightly after Casablancas objected to the song being credited as \"The Strokes and Regina Spektor\", claiming that it should read \"by Regina Spektor & The Strokes\".\n\nThe title \"Reptilia\" refers to the \"Reptilian complex\", the central part of one's brain that handles basic emotions such as love and hate.\n\nThe cover of the single features the artwork from the cabinet of the 1980 arcade game Centipede by Atari.\n\nThe music video for the song was their first that was not directed by Roman Coppola. Instead they chose Jake Scott to shoot the video, which features close shots of the band members' faces and hands while performing the song. At the end of the video, Julian Casablancas spits at the camera lens.\n\nThe song is a playable track in the video games Rock Band and in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. The minor difference is that the overexposed effect on Casablancas' vocals is removed. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/_/Reptilia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
