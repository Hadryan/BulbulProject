It infuses the listener's senses with vignettes of temptation from lusty relationships to recipes that can never satisfy if only sampled once. The instrumentation invokes scenes of cafes in Paris with a woodwind melody that \"breathes\" in and out in contrast to the almost \"breathless\" voice of the narrator. Give this song a listen, and let it intoxicate you. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Suzanne+Vega/_/Caramel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Caramel\" is a song of longing and desire.
