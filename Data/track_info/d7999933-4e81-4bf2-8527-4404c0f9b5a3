However, after Richards edited and mixed the song (including a bit of harmonies recorded for \"A Winter's Tale\") he presented it to the band. May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon then added their instruments and backing vocals and were surprised to end up with a finished song that had begun as nothing. The style of the song is reminiscent of their 1982 album Hot Space, and a comment over that featured on their Greatest Hits III album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/You+Don%27t+Fool+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
