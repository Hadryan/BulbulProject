The song reached #7 on the U.S. charts, #37 in the U.K., #11 in Australia and #2 in Canada. The extended version of the song runs for 6:27 on the Tusk album.\n\nCommenting on the track in interview, Stevie Nicks says that the track is about her best friend Sara Recor Fleetwood, the wife of Mick Fleetwood and the effect she had on relationships within the band during 1978.\n\nNicks herself had an affair with Mick Fleetwood in early 1978 while he was married to Jenny Boyd. Then her best friend, model Sara Recor (at the time married to music manager Jim Recor), fell for Fleetwood and began an affair with him whilst Nicks and Fleetwood were still together. The pair ultimately moved in together, and were subsequently married. Nicks felt very betrayed, but Recor and Fleetwood were undeniably in love. Sara Fleetwood has stated that Nicks and Fleetwood were no longer together when they began their affair, at least that is what Mick told Sara. \"Sara\" was actually written with Sara Recor sitting by Nicks at the piano. Sara claims that Nicks was never upset with her, only with Fleetwood.\n\n\"Sara\" originally had many more verses and ran for 16 minutes in demo form, according to Nicks, and referenced all Fleetwood Mac band members. The song was a commentary on all the tangled relationships and love affairs that were occurring in 1977-1978, but the final recorded version omitted most of this and focused on the triangle between Nicks, Fleetwood and Recor.\n\nNicks wrote the track on a piano, and it was very hard for Mick Fleetwood to put a drum track together for it. He used brushes to make it work.\n\nNicks has stated in interviews that the line \"When you build your house/I'll come by\" was about Don Henley, who was actually building a house at the time, and also that the lyric \"and he was just like a great dark wing\" was a reference to Mick Fleetwood.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Sara\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
