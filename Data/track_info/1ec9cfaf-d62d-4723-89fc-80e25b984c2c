Squire's and Reni's playing gets harder and faster, and harder, and faster, and then there is a sudden stop. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/_/I+Am+the+Resurrection\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"The chorus lyric (\"I am the resurrection and I am the life\") was taken from a church board Ian Brown had seen, quite appropriately, as this song has religious power.

Squire's and Reni's playing gets harder and faster, and harder, and faster, and then there is a sudden stop. The Roses then pick it up where they left off, but then gradually wind down to another classic soft guitar line from Squire. This then builds up again, gaining momentum, until eventually even the Roses fall to the inevitable and gradually fade the song out.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/_/I+Am+the+Resurrection\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
