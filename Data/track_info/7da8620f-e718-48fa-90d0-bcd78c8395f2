It's trying to deal with somebody being two-faced or, even to the extreme, someone having a split personality. The reason for why it's called Cassius - Cassius Clay who became Mohammad Ali, it's almost like there's two people in one and Cassius, the conspirator who instigated the assassination of Julius Caesar, who is a very literal symbol of being two faced\".[1]\n\nThe video was directed by Dave Ma and shows the band playing with hanging hearts and pills.\n\n\"Cassius\" peaked at number 26 on the UK singles chart and is their second highest charting song after \"My Number\" . The song was number 45 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008.\n\n\n\nReleased :   10 March 2008\nFormat\t   :   Digital download, 7\" Vinyl, CD\nGenre\t   :   Math rock, dance-punk\nLength\t   :   3:49\nLabel\t   :   Transgressive Records\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foals/_/Cassius\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
