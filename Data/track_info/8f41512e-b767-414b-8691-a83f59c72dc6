The single appears on the soundtrack to Love Actually.\n\nMusic video\n \nScene from the music video.The video for \"Too Lost in You\" was directed by Andy Morahan and filmed in London Stansted.\n\nIt is set in an airport where the girls are dressed casually, walking in slow motion down the inside walkway. They each catch the eye of an attractive worker, flight attendant, and a passenger, then have dream sequences of themselves seducing their tied down men. Heidi throws ice on her man and feeds it to him, Mutya feels her man up with a sword and cuts the front of his top while Keisha gives her diamond-encrusted-handcuffed man a lap dance. After the completion of the video, clips from the movie Love Actually were placed into the video for the movie's release.\n\nChart Performance\n\nReleased during Christmas week of 2003, the single enjoyed moderate success; entering the UK Singles Chart at #10, where it peaked for two weeks, before slipping five places the following week and falling out of the top 75, after ten weeks on the chart. The song had similar success in Ireland where the single peaked at #13 after already having spent a further three weeks in the top 20. It has so far sold 86000 copies in the UK.\n\n\"Too Lost in You\" also saw success across Europe, where it entered the official charts of twelve countries. Perhaps one of the singles greatest success was in Switzerland, where it peaked at #8, spending seventeen weeks within the top 100 in total. It also entered the Norweigan top 10 at #7, where it spent a total of eleven weeks in the top 20. After their previous single, Hole in the Head failed to chart in France, \"Too Lost in You\" peaked at a satisfactory #22 and peaked within the top 10 on the Dutch Top 40.\n\nFurther afield, the single made a favourable impact on the Australian ARIA and New Zealand RIANZ Singles Charts, peaking at #31 on both charts. Unlike its predecessor, \"Too Lost in You\" failed to chart on the official Billboard Hot 100.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sugababes/_/Too+Lost+in+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
