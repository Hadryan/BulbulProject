The song is said to be about a girl who is in a club, and she has apparently had so much to drink she cannot even remember what the club's name is.\n\nAccording to the Just Dance Songfacts, this was not only the breakthrough hit for Lady Gaga, but was also instrumental in introducing to the Top 40 a techno-synth sound that had been popular in Europe for the previous decade. Lady Gaga’s frequent co-writer and producer RedOne told Billboard the song, “was essentially a rock track but with synths instead of guitars. Big drums. The vocals were the melody, with a simple chorus. Thank God we were lucky and it was perfect timing. The moment the public heard it, they bought into it.”\n\nThe song was featured in the final audition scene of Make It Happen, a 2008 film starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Just+Dance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
