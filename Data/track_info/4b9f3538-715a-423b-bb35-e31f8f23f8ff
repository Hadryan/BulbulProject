The single stayed at the top of Sweden's music chart for eight weeks, succeeded by Fox's second single \"Do Ya Do Ya (Wanna Please Me)\". \"Touch Me\" is deemed to be the singer's signature song.\n\nThe song, recorded at Battery Studios, London, is about her searching for a man. The video featured her performing to a packed crowd wearing ripped denim jeans. During the song she pulls a young man from the crowd and teases him before moving on to someone else. A stand-out scene from the video is the close-up shot of Fox as she is heard moaning in a sexual manner. The song itself is layered with sexual lines, including: \"Like a tramp in the night, I was begging for you, to treat my body like you wanted to\" and of course the chorus itself, \"Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body, your heartbeat next to mine, touch me, touch me NOW!\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Samantha+Fox/_/Touch+Me+(I+Want+Your+Body)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
