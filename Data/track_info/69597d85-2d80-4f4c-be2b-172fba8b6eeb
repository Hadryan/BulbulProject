The former is a bedroom pop-fuelled ballad, featuring Condon singing over keyboard synths and an upbeat drum sound, with synthed strings filling in the gaps later on. On the EP however, the song is replicated with physical instruments. An organ makes up most of the texture of the track with Beirut's trademark brass taking on the countermelody further into the track. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Beirut/_/Scenic+World\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"A song by Beirut which features on their first album, The Gulag Orkestar, and also in another form on the \"Lon Gisland EP\".
