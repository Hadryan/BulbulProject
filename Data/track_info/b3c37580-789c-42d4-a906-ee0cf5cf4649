The first two lines of the song in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come right after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love you... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney said it was a \"50-50 collaboration written to order,\" i.e., for Harrison to sing.\n\nRecording:\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison to sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the world,\" but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" Harrison sang two songs on Please Please Me, this song by Lennon and McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. The Beatles did not record a song composed solely by Harrison until \"Don't Bother Me\" on With The Beatles.\nThe song was recorded during a ten-hour session on 11 February 1963 along with nine other songs for Please Please Me.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nGeorge Harrison - lead guitar, lead vocals\nJohn Lennon - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nPaul McCartney - bass guitar, backing vocals\nRingo Starr - drums <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Do+You+Want+to+Know+a+Secret\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
