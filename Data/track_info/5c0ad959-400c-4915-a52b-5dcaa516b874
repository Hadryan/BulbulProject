Her Biblical account depicts her as a scheming, manipulative woman who did more than anyone to promote an evil religion. Thus, in Christian tradition, a comparison to Jezebel suggests that a person is a pagan or an apostate masquerading as a servant of God, who by manipulation and/or seduction misleads the saints of God into sins of idolatry and sexual immorality, sending them to hell. [3]\n\nIn particular, Jezebel has come to be associated with promiscuity. The phrase \"painted Jezebel\", with connotations of immorality and prostitution, is based on 2 Kings 9:30-33[4]), where Jezebel puts on her makeup just before being killed. (She may have done this to encourage her captors to keep her alive as a consort rather than kill her.) While the Bible generally depicts Jezebel as a faithful wife, she is remembered more for her introduction of Baal worship and its accompanying promiscuity to the Israelites.\n\nWhile Jezebel's sexual image often has a negative connotation, some embrace it, as is evidenced by various lingerie designs named after Jezebel.\n\nIn modern usage, the name of Jezebel is sometimes used as a synonym for sexually promiscuous and sometimes controlling women, as in the title of the 1938 Bette Davis film Jezebel or the 1951 Frankie Laine hit \"Jezebel\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/Jezebel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
