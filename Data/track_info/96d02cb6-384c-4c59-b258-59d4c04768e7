In Buckley's words, \"(It's about) not feeling so bad about your own mortality when you have true love.\"\n\nBuckley invited Lucas to play on the album, along with \"Mojo Pin\"; two songs that Lucas had created the main riffs for, and Buckley had expanded upon, making up the \"Grace\" heard on the album, and earlier on Songs to No One 1991â€“1992; These songs were prominent in gigs around 1991 onwards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley/_/Grace\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
