The song was written and recorded by the band for their seventh studio album In Rainbows (2007), and was produced by Nigel Godrich. One of the band's most direct love songs, \"All I Need\" is a downbeat track which sees frontman Thom Yorke singing of obsession and unrequited love. The recording also incorporates a full string section, a synthesizer, and various other instruments into its instrumentation. Lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood utilized a string section in order to produce the desired effect of white noise produced by a band playing loudly in a room. Prior to its official release on In Rainbows, the song was debuted live by Radiohead at a Chicago, Illinois concert in June 2006.\n\nIn support of the MTV EXIT anti-human trafficking campaign, Radiohead produced a video for \"All I Need\", directed by Steve Rogers, which premiered on May 1, 2008. The clip, which contrasts the lives of two young boys—an average, well-off child from a developed environment, and a sweatshop worker—received critical acclaim and won numerous awards. On 5 January 2009, \"All I Need\" impacted United States adult album alternative radio as the fifth and final single from In Rainbows. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/All+I+Need\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
