For example, when it talks about 'seeing red again,' it means he's getting angry and losing control. The color red often refers to anger. When it talks about asking who makes him see the red, it's most likely from the point of view of a person he is seeking help to control his anger, a counselor or someone of that nature. They are asking who, or what makes him angry, what their triggers are. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chevelle/_/The+Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"The song \"The Red\" by Chevelle is about a person who often has anger problems. For example, when it talks about 'seeing red again,' it means he's getting angry and losing control. The color red often refers to anger. When it talks about asking who makes him see the red, it's most likely from the point of view of a person he is seeking help to control his anger, a counselor or someone of that nature. They are asking who, or what makes him angry, what their triggers are. The line, 'the truth, he gives into most,' that comes right after this part, reveals that almost anyone can set him off. When they say \"it filters through\" it could mean that he can relax and get through the \"anger\" or upset feelings.\n\nNew Author:\nAnother take on the 'it filters through' line: When the person is 'seeing red,' it could refer to him filtering through everyone around him, determining who is bad and who is good. Those marked with 'the red' are those he feels the most anger towards. The song definitely implies the person has anger issues, but it also seems that the person was tormented and isolated by those around him, and that led to the anger that has built up inside. The first lines support this: 'They say 'freak,' when you're singled out.' <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chevelle/_/The+Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
