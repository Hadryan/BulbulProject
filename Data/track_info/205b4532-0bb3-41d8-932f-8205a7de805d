James Taylor played six-string banjo (tuned like a guitar) and sang on the song, and Linda Ronstadt also contributed vocals.\n\nIn the movie Heart of Gold, Young introduces the song as follows:\nâ€œ About that time when I wrote that song [the previously played \"Heart of Gold\"], and I was touring, I had also -- just, you know, being a rich hippie for the first time -- I had purchased a ranch, and I still live there today. And there was a couple living on it that were the caretakers, an old gentleman named Louis Avala and his wife Clara. And there was this old blue Jeep there, and Louis took me for a ride in this blue Jeep. He gets me up there on the top side of the place, and there's this lake up there that fed all the pastures, and he says, \"Well, tell me, how does a young man like yourself have enough money to buy a place like this?\" And I said, \"Well, just lucky, Louie, just real lucky.\" And he said, \"Well, that's the darndest thing I ever heard.\" And I wrote this song for him.\" \n\nHe tells a similar story when introducing the song at a February 23, 1971 performance broadcast by the BBC (in which he says that he purchased the ranch from \"two lawyers\").\n\nCovers\nBob Dylan regularly covered this song at a number of concerts on his 2002 tour, including one at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Dylan played the keyboard on his arrangement of the song.\n\nThe song was covered by American R&B/Soul singer N'Dea Davenport on her 1998 debut album, N'Dea Davenport.\n\nIn 2003 Howard Stern and The Losers covered the song on his radio show.\n\nIn 2004 the song was covered by Canadian folk trio The Wailin' Jennys for their debut full length album, 40 Days.\n\nIn 2004 the song was covered by Pop trio Wilson Phillips for their covers album, California.\n\nIn 2008, the two man internet band \"Count Gilbert\" covered this song for a single. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Old+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
