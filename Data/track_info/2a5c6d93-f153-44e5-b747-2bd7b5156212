They regularly covered the song during live sets after their memorable acoustic performance up until lead singer Kurt Cobain's death in 1994.\n\nThe song was released as a promo single for the album and received considerable airplay on alternative rock radio stations. It was also thrown into heavy rotation on music video stations such as MTV.\n\nIn the wake of this cover, Bowie bemoaned the fact that when he performed the number himself he would encounter \"kids that come up afterwards and say, 'It's cool you're doing a Nirvana song.'
