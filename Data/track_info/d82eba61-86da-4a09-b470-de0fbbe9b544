Resulting in a imaginary clip which is almost impossible to interpret the first time you see it. \"Will my eyes be closed or open?\".\n\n\"Basically, 'Hyper-ballad' is about having this kind of bag going on and three years have passed (in a relationship) and you're not high anymore. You have to make an effort consciously and nature's not helping you anymore. So you wake up early in the morning and you sneak outside and you do something horrible and destructive, break whatever you can find, watch a horrible film, read a bit of William Burroughs, something really gross and come home and be like, 'Hi honey, how are you?'.\"\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/_/Hyperballad\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
