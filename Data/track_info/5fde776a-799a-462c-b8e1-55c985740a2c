This song, one of their signature songs, deals with what is commonly referred to as the \"military-industrial complex\", which is the tendency of industry (the arms industry in particular) to encourage military action in order to gain military contracts, and therefore increase its profits.\n\nThe song features one of Tom Morello's most famous guitar riffs and a highly unusual solo that sounds more like someone fucking a rubber duck than a guitar by making use of the toggle switch and rubbing his hand along the strings parallel to the neck of the guitar. It is usually cited as the most famous example of Tom Morello's extremely innovative guitar playing. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine/_/Bulls+on+Parade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
