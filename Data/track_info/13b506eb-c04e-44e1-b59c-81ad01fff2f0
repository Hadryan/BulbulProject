On May 25 the single was released on 7-inch red vinyl to coincide with the release of the album. There is also a 7-inch picture disc release which includes the same track listing.\n\n\"Duality\" was the band's first single to chart in the Billboard Hot 100, at number 106, and it also reached band records of number five and six in the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts. In the UK Single Chart, the song reached number 15.\n\nThe music video, directed by Tony Petrossian, was produced at a cost between $300,000 and $500,000 and was recorded on March 27, 2004. It was shot on location at a fan's house in West Des Moines, Iowa, the aftermath of which resulted in the family asking the band to replace an extensive list of objects and fittings which were damaged or destroyed during the video shoot. Roadrunner Records provided the family with roughly $50,000 as compensation. The video is available on the CD single and the DVD; Voliminal: Inside The Nine, which was released in 2006. Mid-way through shooting the video, the band and fans were asked to avoid jumping around too much, as it would have resulted in either the floor caving in or the entire house collapsing.\n\nThe video starts with a large crowd of fans running towards the camera which is clearly behind a window. As the song switches in intensity the video cuts to shots inside the house of the band performing in very close quarters with the fans. The video constantly switches between clips of the band performing and fans destroying the house and the surrounding environment. At one point in the video, when lead singer Corey Taylor sings the lyrics, \"You cannot kill what you did not create\", the words are seen painted on the garage door behind the crowd of fans. Near the end of the song there is a coda section where the music and singing builds up to a highly energetic section. Prior to this Corey seemingly calms the crowd with an outstretched arm, which is followed with Corey pacing through the crowd repeating the lyrics \"All I've got, all I've got is insane\". Then the scene cuts and an even larger crowd is situated outside watching the performance. Once the chorus begins again the crowd immediately continues to destroy their surroundings and the song suddenly ends. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Slipknot/_/Duality\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
