The song has a psychedelic feel, similar to some of The Beatles' later work with echoed guitar and finger cymbals. The lyrics describe a Utopian place that one can feel in their heart, despite the chaos of the world around them. \"Paisley Park\" was recorded before Purple Rain was completed, indicating the new direction Prince wanted to take after the success of that album and film. Violin on the song was played by Novi Novog, and Wendy & Lisa provide backing vocals. The rest of the song was performed by Prince. The song reached the Top 40 in all of the countries it was released in. It peaked within the Top 20 in both Ireland (No. 11) and the UK (No. 18)\n\n\"She's Always in My Hair\"[edit]\nThe B-side of the single was \"She's Always in My Hair\", which was also on the U.S. release of \"Raspberry Beret\". Many copies of the 12\" single are mis-pressed, featuring four tracks instead of the three mentioned on the sleeve (\"She's Always In My Hair\" being present twice). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/She%27s+Always+In+My+Hair\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
