The high-pitch guitar sounds on the track came from a Whammy pedal which makes the guitar sound an octave higher, also known as a pitch shifter. Alike to \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" this song also used the shrill siren-like sound effect of the song \"Echoes\".\n\nThe track was given a Grammy Award in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1994.\n\nThis song has only been played live 3 times. On the two dates in Oslo (one of which is featured on the Pulse DVD), Norway on the 1994 \"The Division Bell\" tour and at the \"Strat Pack\" charity concert, for the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar, where Gilmour played his \"#0001\" Stratocaster.\n\nThis song was featured on Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd but was severely shortened in length to 2:02.\n\nin 2014, for the 20th Anniversary of The Division Bell, a video was filmed by Aubrey Powell filming some parts in Ukraine.\n///////////////////////////////\n\n\nThis won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Recording. It was the only Grammy Pink Floyd ever won.\n\nThis was one of three songs from The Division Bell to appear on the Pink Floyd Greatest Hits Double CD, Echoes. The others were \"High Hopes\" and \"Keep Talking\". >> <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Marooned\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
