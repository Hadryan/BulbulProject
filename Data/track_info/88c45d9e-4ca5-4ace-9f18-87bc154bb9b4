It was a stand alone single rather than taken from any studio album, although it was included on the compilation album Suedehead: The Best of Morrissey.\nRather than continuing with the rockabilly sound of \"Pregnant for the Last Time\", Morrissey and song writing partner Mark Nevin returned to a poppier sound for the final single they would release together. Featuring Chrissie Hynde on harmony vocals, the single reached number 29 in the UK singles chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/_/My+Love+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"My Love Life\" was a single by Morrissey released in September 1991.
