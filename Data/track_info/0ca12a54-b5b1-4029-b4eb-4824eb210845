The song is notable for being the first song to reach #1 in the US by an all-girl group.\n\nAt Carole King's home, in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles, her doorbell rang the title of the song.\n\nThe Shirelles released their version as Scepter single 1211, with \"Boys\" on the B-side. The single's first pressing was simply \"Tomorrow\" then lengthened later. When first presented with the song, lead singer Shirley Owens (later known as Shirley Alston-Reeves) did not want to record it, because she thought it was \"too country.\" She relented after a string arrangement was added.\n\n In 1961, the song went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. However, Owens recalled on Jim Parsons' syndicated oldies radio program, Shake Rattle Showtime, that some radio stations had banned the record because they had felt the lyrics were too sexually charged.\n\nThis version of the song is currently ranked as the 101st greatest song of all time, as well as the best song of 1960, by Acclaimed Music.[1]\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Shirelles/_/Will+You+Love+Me+Tomorrow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
