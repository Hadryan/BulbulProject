Metallica has used \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" as the introductory music for its concerts since 1984; it is included on the live symphonic album S&M. A instrumental metal cover by Metallica (with minimal vocals by lead singer James Hetfield) appears on the 2007 Morricone tribute album We All Love Ennio Morricone. This rock version was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance. It was also used in the trailer for and appears in Guitar Hero: Metallica, in its original form as composed by Morricone. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/The+Ecstasy+of+Gold\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
