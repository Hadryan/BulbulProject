It was also included on the band's sixth studio album, Kick. The music was written by Andrew Farriss, who recorded a blues style demo and gave it to Michael Hutchence. The INXS singer then penned a personal love lyric, which was straight from the heart.\n\n\"Never Tear Us Apart\" is a sensuous ballad, layered with synthesizers and containing dramatic pauses before the instrumental breaks. Kirk Pengilly lends a cathartic saxophone solo near the end. According to the liner notes of Shine Like It Does: The Anthology (1979â€“1997), the song was originally composed on piano as a bluesy number in the style of Fats Domino. Producer Chris Thomas suggested a synth-based arrangement instead.\n\nThe video for the song, featuring an extended intro, was filmed in various locations in Prague along with \"Guns in the Sky\" and \"New Sensation,\" all directed by Richard Lowenstein.\n\nThe single reached #24 in the UK, and stayed on the charts for seven weeks. In the U.S., it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMichael Hutchence's coffin was carried out of St. Andrews Cathedral by the remaining members of INXS and younger brother Rhett, as \"Never Tear Us Apart\" was played in the background. This song is now thought of by many original INXS fans as Hutchence's anthem.\n\nThe song was used in the opening sequence of the director's cut of the 2001 cult film, Donnie Darko. It would have been featured in the original release had the rights for it not been deemed too expensive by the producers. (\"The Killing Moon\" by Echo & the Bunnymen served as its replacement.)\n\nIn 2006, the song was voted \"Nation's Favourite Lyric\" by viewers of pay TV music channel VH1 in Australia.\n\nRecently, the song has been adopted by The Squadron, the Newcastle United Jets supporter group, and sung in unison at the 40th and 85th minute of their A-League association football matches. This is in homage to the line, \"cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know why\", used now in reference to the Jets symbol of their club. The song's popularity has prompted a move to have the song be played at the beginning of each half, first happening on the 18th October 2008, when the Jets defeated the Melbourne Victory 1-0. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/INXS/_/Never+Tear+Us+Apart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
