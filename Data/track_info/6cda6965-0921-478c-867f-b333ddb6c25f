The song is based around a four-note keyboard part, with a distorted guitar riff at the beginning and after the second chorus.\n\nThe single's video, directed by Stéphane Sednaoui, was included as a bonus video on the DVD release of In View - The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003. \"I wanted to work with Stephane for a long time,\" Stipe explained to MTV UK during An Hour with R.E.M. in 2001 after selecting the video for airplay. \"Since I saw the video that he did with Björk for, what was that called, \"Big Time Sexuality\" or something? Where she looks exactly like Shirley MacLaine, 1959-1961. The Apartment, I think, was the name of the film. Shirley McLaine and Björk as Shirley MacLaine on the back of a pick-up truck driving down 5th Avenue in New York City, probably. But I thought this guy exudes sex, he's like sex on a stick, and I wanted to work with him for that reason. He somehow transmogrified that very thing through me. I look very, very foxy in this video, which is why I chose it; it shows off my incredible stomach muscles.\"\n\nFor live performances of the song, Peter Buck alternates between electric guitar (chorus) and keyboard (verse). \"[Playing keyboard] always excites me,\" Buck explained in a soundbite during MTV Uplink, a recording of the band's performance at New York's Bowery Ballroom in October 1998, \"even though it's only with one finger.\" \"But it's a big finger,\" joked Mills. \"It's great.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/Lotus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
