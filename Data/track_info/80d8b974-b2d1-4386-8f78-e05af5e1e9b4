It is performed frequently by Helloween and Gamma Ray at their concerts, and is usually used for crowd participation, usually with the crowd singing the first verse, sometimes after the singer shouts the first phrase. Also there is a certain \"game\", that when the band jams, the singer signals the crowd to shout: \"We all live in future world\" a few times near the end of the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Helloween/_/Future+World\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Future World\" is a song and a single made by the German heavy metal band Helloween taken from the album Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1.
