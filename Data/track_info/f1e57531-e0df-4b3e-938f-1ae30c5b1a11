Despite a midweek release, the song entered the UK singles chart at number 11, making it the band's highest charting single since \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" in 2007.\n\nIn terms of both lyrical content and aesthetic style, \"Do I Wanna Know?\" picks up from where the band's 2012 single \"R U Mine?\" left off. The guitar riffs are strikingly similar, but the song is more downtempo. The track continues the hard-edged, rocking sound of their previous album Suck It and See. In concert, singer and guitarist Alex Turner uses a Vox 12 string electric guitar. The song is in G minor. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/_/Do+I+Wanna+Know%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
