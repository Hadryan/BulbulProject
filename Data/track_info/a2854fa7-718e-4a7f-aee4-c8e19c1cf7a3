Howlin' Wolf, the late Chester Burnett, had recorded a song called \"How Many More Years\" in 1951, and all new Led Zeppelin releases since 1993 have co-credited the song to the Burnett via arrangement with his publishing company, ARC Music.

Cover versions by many artists, such as the LA Guns 1999 version on the album Shrinking Violet, however, are not credited to Burnett.\n\nThough listed at a time of 3:30 on the album sleeve, the correct length of the track is in fact 8:28. The incorrect listing was deliberate as it was intended to help promote radio play. Page knew that radio stations would never play a song over eight minutes long, so he wrote the track time as shorter on the album to trick radio stations into playing it.\n\nIt has also been reported that the \"Rosie\" and \"Hunter\" components of the song came spontaneously to the group on the night of the recording session. The \"Hunter\" component is taken from \"The Hunter\" recorded by bluesman Albert King with Booker T & the MGs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/How+Many+More+Times\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
