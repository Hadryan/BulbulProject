Simon Draper said to John 'did that really happen to you?'  I don't know what John said.  A lot of people wondered about that.  I just think it was a thing we made up.  Basically, for me, the track goes on too fucking long.  I wish I caught that.  If I did it, I'd wrap it up a lot quicker and clean it up a bit.  That's our second attempt at that.

It was a hard line for me to keep playing.  I kept doing it again and overdubbing it and then I just decided that I couldn't keep doing it.  I still didn't quite have it.  I knew what I wanted... I can play it now beautiful.  When I actually hear it on Metal Box, it's not what I was doing.  That's OK because that's what PiL was about.  If I re-recorded it now, I would make it much more refined.'\n\nInterview with Keith Levene, May 2001. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Public+Image+Ltd./_/Poptones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
