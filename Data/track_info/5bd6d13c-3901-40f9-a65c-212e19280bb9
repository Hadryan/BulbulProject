It achieved success in many countries, including Italy, Great Britain, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Spain, where it was a top ten hit.\nIn 2005, the song was used as an outro for Australia's Nine's Wide World of Sport coverage;[citation needed] in Italy, in a commercial for Vodafone[1]; and on ITV Sport, for the theme of their Formula One coverage.[2] This was remixed with a variety of sounds to give it a faster pace. The song was featured in the racing game Asphalt: Urban GT 2 for mobile phones and Nintendo DS, and was used in the Beatmania series of rhythm games.[citation needed] The track also featured on the soundtrack to the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada and was also the theme for Discovery Quest's Expedition Borneo on the Discovery Channel in February 2007.[citation needed] As well, the song was featured in the thirteenth episode of the third season of Doctor Who Confidential.\n\nMoby claims to have written the song in 2004 after the reelection of President George W. Bush, adding that it reflected his consideration to emigrate to Canada in protest. This song originally was to be sung with The Sisters of Mercy's singer Andrew Eldritch and is partly inspired by that band's material. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Moby/_/Lift+Me+Up\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
