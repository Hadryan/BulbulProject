Cooper said: \"There's two times during the year. One is Christmas morning, when you're just getting ready to open the presents. The greed factor is right there. The next one is the last three minutes of the last day of school when you're sitting there and it's like a slow fuse burning. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+Cooper/_/School%27s+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"School's Out\" is a 1972 title track single released on Alice Cooper's fifth album,School's Out.\n\nCooper has said he was inspired to write the song when answering the question, \"What's the greatest three minutes of your life?\".

The next one is the last three minutes of the last day of school when you're sitting there and it's like a slow fuse burning. I said, 'If we can catch that three minutes in a song, it's going to be so big.'\"\n\nCooper has also said it was inspired by a line from a Bowery Boys movie. On his radio show, \"Nights with Alice Cooper,\" he joked that the main riff of the song was inspired by a song by Miles Davis.\n\nThe lyrics of \"School's Out\" indicate that not only is the school year ended for summer vacation, but ended forever, and that the school itself has been blown up. It incorporates the childhood rhyme, \"No more pencils, no more books, no more teachers' dirty looks\" into its lyrics. It also featured children contributing some of the vocals.\n\n\"School's Out\" became Alice Cooper's first major hit single, reaching #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart and propelling the album to #2 on the Billboard 200 pop albums chart. The song reached #1 on the UK singles chart for three weeks in August 1972. It also marked the first time that Alice Cooper became regarded as more than just a theatrical novelty act.\n\nThe single version of the song is a mono audio mix of the album version with one major difference - the \"turn-off\" effect used upon the school bell and sound effects at the end of the album version is not used on the single version, allowing the school bell and effects to simply fade out. A palm-muted guitar track is also much more prevalent at the beginning of the single version.\n\nIn 2004, \"School's Out\" was ranked #319 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2009 it was named the 35th best hard rock song of all time by VH1. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+Cooper/_/School%27s+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
