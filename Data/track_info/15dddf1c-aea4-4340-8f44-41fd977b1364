It was written by Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan, and produced by Allen Toussaint and Vicki Wickham. It was released on August 3, 1974 as the first single from the album Nightbirds. The song was inspired by Crewe's first-hand observations of New Orleans. After it was first recorded by Nolan's group Eleventh Hour in 1974, on Eleventh Hour's Greatest Hits LP, Labelle's producer Allen Toussaint decided to record it for Nightbirds. The song is famous for its sexually suggestive chorus of \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?\", which translates into English as \"Do you want to sleep with me (tonight)?\"\n\nThe song held the number-one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week, and topped the Canadian RPM national singles chart on the same date. Labelle's version of \"Lady Marmalade\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003 and was ranked number 479 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe song has had many cover versions over the years. In 1998, all female group All Saints released a cover of the song that peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart. The 2001 version by singers Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mýa, and Pink, produced by Missy Elliott with instrumentals contributed by producer Rockwilder, was released for the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack. It was a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US for 5 weeks and won Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mýa, and Pink a Grammy Award. In the United Kingdom, the song has been sung on several talent shows, including The X Factor by Leona Lewis, and on Eurovision: Your Country Needs You by Jade Ewen.\n\nPatti LaBelle sang lead vocals on \"Lady Marmalade\" with backing vocals being contributed by band mates Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash. The song's chorus, \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?\", appeared previously in the play A Streetcar Named Desire, uttered by the promiscuous Blanche DuBois.\n\n\"Lady Marmalade\" was a number-one hit for one week on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the United States during the early spring of 1975, and charted at number one for one week on the Billboard Top Soul Singles chart. Along with the track, \"What Can I Do for You?\", \"Lady Marmalade\" peaked at number seven on the disco/dance charts. The single also charted at number seventeen in the United Kingdom. \"Lady Marmalade\" replaced another Crewe/Nolan composition, Frankie Valli's \"My Eyes Adored You\", as the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, a feat that made Crewe and Nolan the third songwriting team in Billboard history (after Lennon–McCartney and Holland-Dozier-Holland) to replace themselves at number-one. Also in 1975, Nanette Workman recorded a French version that became very popular in Canada (Quebec).\n\nThe song was first covered by Nanette Workman in the same year, and then later on by Sheila E. on her 1991 album Sex Cymbal in a jazz-oriented rendition, with horns as the centerpiece. In 1995, disco cover band Boogie Knights covered \"Lady Marmalade\", fronted by singer Jeff Scott Soto. In 1999, the song was covered by the techno act Lords of Acid as a bonus track on their remix album Expand Your Head. More recently, the track was featured in the TV series Angel, performed by actor Andy Hallett, and was released on the soundtrack in 2005. The Labelle version appears in several films, including The Long Kiss Goodnight, Dick, and Jacob's Ladder.\n\nImprobably, the lyrics to the song were sung to the tune of the \"Toreador Song\" from \"Carmen\" by Tim Brooke-Taylor on the radio comedy and panel game show I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue as part of a round called \"One Song to the Tune of Another\". It was featured on the video game Karaoke Revolution Volume 2 as a version performed with Patti LaBelle.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Patti+LaBelle/_/Lady+Marmalade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
