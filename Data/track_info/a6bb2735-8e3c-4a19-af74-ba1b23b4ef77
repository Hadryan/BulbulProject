When asked on the motivations of the stance, Bangalter said:\n\n“ I don't think it's the music they're after, it's the parties... I don't know. They pretend it's drugs, but I don't think it's the only thing. There's drugs everywhere, but they probably wouldn't have a problem if the same thing was going on at a rock concert, because that's what they understand. They don't understand this music which is really violent and repetitive, which is house; they consider it dumb and stupid. \"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/_/Revolution+909\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
