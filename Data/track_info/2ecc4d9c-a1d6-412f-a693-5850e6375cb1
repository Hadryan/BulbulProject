Originally, the song \"Comfort Eagle\" was slated to be released, but the events of September 11, 2001 gave the band reason to pull it; events described in the song (such as airplanes falling and people stepping off ledges) paralleled the scene of terrorist attacks on New York and The Pentagon. \"Love You Madly\" was released in its place. The song is relatively unusual in its use of the Theremin as a primary instrument. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cake/_/Love+You+Madly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Love You Madly\" is the third single from Cake's Comfort Eagle album.
