Physical copies of the single were made available on 17 August, one week before the release of the album. The vinyl was made available in Oxfam shops and sold with a download code for fans to get a free MP3 version of the song. The single debuted at #12 on the UK Singles Chart on 12 July 2009 by downloads alone.\n\nThe music video for the single debuted on Channel 4 in UK on 24 July 2009. It was directed by Richard Ayoade, who worked with the band previously on the video for Fluorescent Adolescent, as well as their \"At the Apollo\" live DVD. The video features the band performing the song on a boat on a rough sea. During a short instrumental interlude, a large figure rises up from the sea in the form of frontman, Turner. He falls to his knees where the boat passes between his legs before the other three band members also rise up out from the water.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/_/Crying+Lightning\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
