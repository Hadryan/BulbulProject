It is Oasis's 2nd biggest selling single in the UK with sales of 720,000 achieving platinum status in the process. It was the 12th biggest selling single of 1997 in the UK. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 77 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\"\n\nIn a 1997 interview promoting Be Here Now, Noel Gallagher had the following to say about the first single: \"I was going to make up some profound statement in the chorus but I couldn't come up with anything that fitted. Then I just thought \"All my people right here, right now. D'You Know What I Mean? Yeah, Yeah\" Very vague, very ambiguous, that'll do. Look in the mirror and wink while you're singing it and it's quite saucy. And I fucking love that line, 'Coming in a mess, going out in style'. We were a bunch of scruffs from Manchester and we're going out in a Rolls Royce.\"\n\nIn another 1997 interview, this time on BBC, Noel Gallagher said: \"I can't believe I wrote it, it's going to blow people away.\"\n\n\"The morse code in the background was inspired by Strawberry Fields. We got hold of a code book and tried to tap out 'Bugger All' to follow that line 'Don't look back cos you know what you might see'. But if anyone can tell me what we really said, please let me know. Profound lagerisms...\"\n\nIn an interview with the BBC for their documentary Seven Ages of Rock, Gallagher said of the song, \"Its eight and a half minutes, the first single, the drums haven't fuckin' come in for two minutes- its all feedback!\". He also says that he expected someone to ask them to edit the introduction to the song down, but such was their status in Britain, nobody did. They even performed the song on Top of the Pops, omitting most of the lengthy introduction. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/D%27You+Know+What+I+Mean%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
