On the Limited 12\", there are pictures of all four members.\n\n\"World in My Eyes\" has two exclusive B-sides, making Violator the only Depeche Mode album with all four singles having at least one exclusive B-Side, including instrumentals. The later album Songs of Faith and Devotion only has one, and while all four Music for the Masses singles have at least one B-side, some of them do appear on the album. In addition, the Construction Time Again singles each had exclusive B-sides, but there were only two singles in support of that album. The B-sides for \"World in My Eyes\" are \"Happiest Girl\" and \"Sea of Sin\".\n\n\"Happiest Girl (Jack Mix)\" and \"Sea of Sin (Tonal Mix)\" are the main 7\" versions. \"Regular\" versions were never released or rather these mixes are the regular versions according to interviews and the official website.\n\nThe music video for \"World in My Eyes\" is directed by Anton Corbijn. There are two versions, the original version was not originally released to the public until The Videos 86-98. The original music video features some footage from the World Violation Tour, while David Gahan and a girl he's with watch it from a drive-in theater. The alternate version on Strange Too features the band in the car instead, more live footage, and the silent ending with David is longer. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/World+in+My+Eyes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
