It was filmed near the Salton Sea in southern California in 2003, during a sandstorm. The filming process itself was fraught with problems, as the sand caused problems with the recording equipment and lighting set-up. The shoot eventually took 22 hours to complete, with Abe Cunningham saying that \"[the shoot] sucked\" and Chi Cheng calling it \"terrible\", but conceding that \"it [is] a trippy video. I actually like it a lot\".\n\n==TRACK LISTING==\n\n1. \"Minerva\" – 4:17 (Deftones)\n2. \"Sinatra\" – 4:34 (Hamilton)\n3. \"Sleep Walk\" – 2:30 (Farina/Farina)\n\nThe second and third tracks are covers. \"Sinatra\", written by Page Hamilton, was originally performed by Helmet on 1990's Strap It On, while \"Sleep Walk\" is a cover of a highly popular 1959 single by Santo & Johnny. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/_/Minerva\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
