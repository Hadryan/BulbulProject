The track's commercial success has led it to becoming one of the best known songs by the band.\n\"Heaven\" took Warrant's record company by surprise. Indeed, once the widespread appeal of the song became apparent, the band were instructed to re-record the track to lend it a \"bigger radio sound\". The first 250,000 copies of the record featured the original version while later pressings featured a new version. The song had previously been recorded by Jani Lane and Steven Sweet's old band Plain Jane. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Warrant/_/Heaven\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
