It was the first of three instant chart-toppers for the group.\n\nSong profile\n\n\"Going Underground\" was not released on any of the band's six studio albums initially, although it has appeared on many compilation/re-releases since then. The single's B-side was \"Dreams of Children\", which had originally been intended to be the A-side; following a mix-up at the pressing plant, the single became a double-A-side, and DJs tended to choose the more melodic \"Going Underground\" to play on the radio.\n\nThe song provided the inspiration for the Nemesis the Warlock character in the weekly comic book 2000 AD. The song was parodied in 2004 by the Amateur Transplants as \"London Underground\", a humorous song full of abuse at the London Underground Strike. It was also turned into \"Go England\" by Virgin Radio for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In March 2005, Q magazine placed \"Going Underground\" at number 73 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, and in October 2006 placed it at number 98 in their list of the 100 Greatest Songs Ever.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jam/_/Going+Underground\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
