The song's widespread appeal was described in the book \"The Pitchfork 500\": \"Pop fans, rock fans, rap fans, children, Mennonites, high-school principals, the elderly, terrorists â€” everybody loved this song. Animals loved it. Silverware loved it. You could play it in a forest with nobody to hear it and have complete faith that the very trees would throw up their branches.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/OutKast/_/Hey+Ya%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
