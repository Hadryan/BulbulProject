One of Hendrix's most played efforts, the track has been included on a number of greatest hits collections, including Jimi Hendrix: The Ultimate Experience. 'The Experience' frequently opened live concerts with this song.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers covered the song. They did so from their early beginnings, around March 1983, on a regular basis during their gigs. They recorded their version of Fire during the Freaky Styley sessions, but the song was left off of the album but released as a B-Side on a few of the band's singles. When the band's original guitarist Hillel Slovak died in 1988, the recording of \"Fire\" was added as a tribute to the late guitarist to the track list of Mother's Milk, released in 1989. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jimi+Hendrix+Experience/_/Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
