It was directed by Adam Jones and, like other Tool videos, includes several abstract scenes (which can be seen on the single art). These include humanoids meeting and cutting pomaceous fruit, then vomiting a black liquid in a circle. Another scene, starring English musician Tricky, includes him dissecting a small biped and then wandering in the forest. It hardly met the criteria for being broadcast on mainstream music video stations, although some channels worked around this by cutting the \"Parabol\" intro. \n\nAnd Parabol/Parabola which is a(n) Arc of some type. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/Parabola\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
