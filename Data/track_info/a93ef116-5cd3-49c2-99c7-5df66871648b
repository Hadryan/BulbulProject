In 1962 King Kong vs. Godzilla hit theaters all over. The song lyrics depict famous scenes of Godzilla films.\n\nAccording to the book Contents Under Pressure: 30 Years Of Rush, while opening on tour with Blue Oyster Cult, Rush members replaced a sound recording that queued up with a video of Godzilla at the opening of the set with a recording of \"Hello, My name is Mister Ed.\" The two bands often played pranks on one another during the tour.\n\nHideki Matsui of The New York Yankees is nicknamed Godzilla and at home games this is played when he comes up to bat.\n\nIn 1998, a new Godzilla movie was released. This song wasn't used in the movie, since producers wanted something more contemporary. They used a P. Diddy song called \"Come With Me\" on the soundtrack.\n\nDuring the second half of the song, Japanese words are spoken: \"Rinji news o moshiagemasu! Rinji news o moshiagemasu! Gojira ga Ginza hoomen e mukatte imasu! Daishikyu hinan shite kudasai! Daishikyu hinan shite kudasai!\" Translated to English: \"Attention, emergency news! Attention, emergency news! Godzilla is going toward the Ginza area! Immediately escape, catch up, find shelter please! Immediately escape, catch up, find shelter please!\"\n\nA 12\" single of this song (Columbia 3-10725, 1977 promo) was produced with the studio version on one side and a live version (that is not the version found on either Some Enchanted Evening or Extraterrestrial Live) on the other side - the song is most easily identified by Eric's introduction - \"It's not Raymond Burr, it's Godzilla!\"  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blue+%C3%96yster+Cult/_/Godzilla\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
