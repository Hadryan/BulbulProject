It was written by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.\n\nThe song was performed, with Marianne Faithfull, on the December 6, 1997 edition of Saturday Night Live when Metallica was the musical guest. A live version of the song was released as b-side to the single The Unforgiven II. It was later performed with the San Francisco Symphony (conducted by Michael Kamen) on S&M. Another live version was included on Orgullo, Pasi√≥n y Gloria. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/The+Memory+Remains\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
