It is performed by the band Lustra (although commonly mis-credited to the band Sum 41), but in the movie, the lead singer was portrayed by Matt Damon, whose character has surreptitiously stolen a girl from \"Scotty,\" hence the title and subject matter.\n\nThe song contains numerous lewd references to how Scotty's girlfriend Fiona (played by Kristin Kreuk) has been cheating on him with Damon's character for an extended period of time. In the movie, the song becomes something of a popular phenomenon: a week or so later in Bratislava, the song has been remixed and is playing in a popular nightclub. By the end of the movie, it has become so widespread and (presumably) popular that Scotty's best friend Cooper is able to use it as his cell phone ringtone. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lustra/_/Scotty+Doesn%27t+Know\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
