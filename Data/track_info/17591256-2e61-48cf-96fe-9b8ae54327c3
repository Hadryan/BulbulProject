According to former Clash co-manager Kosmo Vinyl, Headon's original words were a filthy ode to his girlfriend. Vinyl recalled to Rolling Stone: \"He had really pornographic lyrics for it if I remember correctly. Very, very pornographic lyrics.\" Strummer's inspiration for re-working the song came from the Clash's other manager, Bernie Rhodes, who asked the band, \"Does everything have to be as long as a raga?\" after a particularly long take of the track \"Sean Flynn.\" Strummer told Rolling Stone shortly before he died in 2002: \"I got back to the hotel that night and wrote on a typewriter, 'The King told the boogie men You gotta get that raga drop.' I looked at it and for some reason I started to think about what someone had told me earlier, that you get lashed for owning a disco album in Iran.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash/_/Rock+the+Casbah\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
