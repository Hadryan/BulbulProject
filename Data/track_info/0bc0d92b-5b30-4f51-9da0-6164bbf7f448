In his biography, \"Many Years From Now\", McCartney is quoted as saying that the song is one of his favourites. Beatles' producer George Martin has also mentioned it as one of his favorite Paul McCartney songs.\nThe song is known for its bittersweet tune, harmonic scheme, and subtle arrangement. The cheerful melody of the verses is counteracted by the more haunting minor modes of the bridge. McCartney, in fact, mentioned in the 1989 radio series McCartney On McCartney that the beginning with its ooh-aah backing vocals was meant to have a Beach Boys sound.\n\nThis track features one of McCartney's highest vocals; he said in his autobiography that he was actually trying to sing it in the style of Marianne Faithfull. His vocals are multi-tracked.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Here,+There+and+Everywhere\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
