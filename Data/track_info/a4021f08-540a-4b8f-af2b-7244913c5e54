Change.\" album backing vocal during the chorus and bridge of live performances. As early as February 2005, however, as evidenced on the R.E.M. Live disc, the band worked up an alternative whereby the backing vocals would be shared amongst Mike Mills, Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow in order to make the song flow more smoothly. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/Leaving+New+York\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
