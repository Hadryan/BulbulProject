The song was first released as a single (With B-Side song \"You Can't Stop Rock & Roll\") on April 27, 1984. The Stay Hungry album was released two weeks later, on May 10, 1984. The single reached #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, making it Twisted Sister's only Top 40 single. The song was ranked #47 on 100 Greatest 80's Songs and #21 on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s.\n\nThe song was written by vocalist Dee Snider. As influences for the song, he cites the glam rock band Slade, the punk band Sex Pistols, and the Christmas carol, \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\".\n\nIt is also possible that the concluding words of a certain ranting statement, made by Peter Finch's character Howard Beale in the 1976 American movie Network, may have been inspirational in Dee Snider's choice of lyrics for the song.\n\n\"We're Not Gonna Take It\" is also the title of the last song on The Who's Tommy album, but there is no connection between the two.\n\nThe song is notable for its popular music video directed by Marty Callner, with its emphasis on slapstick comedy, where a parent gets the worst of the band's mischief. Controversy arose when the depiction of the family in the video caused a public outcry long before the \"explicit lyrics\" warning was placed on records, cassettes, and CDs. This led to the formation of the Parents Music Resource Center. Mark Metcalf, the actor portraying the father in the video, had previously played Neidermayer, the ROTC student commander in National Lampoon's Animal House (1978). In a reference to his role in the film, Metcalf says \"A Twisted Sister pin? On your uniform?!\" in the video. Snider himself can also be heard cursing and swearing the question \"A pledge pin? On your uniform?\" at the end of the song. The actor (Dax Callner) portraying the teenager went on to become a rock singer.\n\nIn 1999, the US rock band Lit parodied the opening scene in their video for \"Zip Lock\". The crazy father was played by Dee Snider.\n\nThe song has been covered by various artists including:\n\n    * American ska punk band Less Than Jake for the 1997 punk rock/emo compilation Where's The Beef\n    * American The Huntingtons for their 1998 album All the Stuff (And More)-Vol 1\n    * American hardcore-punk band Global Threat on their 1999 album What the fuck will change?\n    * Canadian rock singer Bif Naked for the Ready to Rumble soundtrack in 2000\n    * American Joan Jett for a 2001 tribute album Twisted Forever - A Tribute To The Legendary Twisted Sister\n    * Thee Ultra Bimboos\n    * German pop punk band The Donots in 2002 (which became a minor hit in Germany, reaching 33 in the Singles Chart)\n    * Chilean band Los Mox in Spanish for their album Con Cover (the title of the song in Spanish is \"No lo aceptaremos\")\n    * Mexican glam rock band Moderatto in Spanish (\"No lo Aceptaremos\") (which was released in 2007 for the Mexican Consejo de la Comunicación, the organization connected to the Ad Council) anti-corruption advertising campaign)\n    * Australian pop duo The Veronicas, which was available for download and also used in a 2008 birth control pill commercial called Yaz\n    * Swedish trio Hellsongs on their 2008 album Hymns In The Key Of 666\n    * Holland street rock'n'roll band Discipline on their 2008 album Old Pride, New Glory\n    * Spanish oi! band Oi!
