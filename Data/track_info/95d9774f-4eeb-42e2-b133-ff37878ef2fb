It was written by guitarist Daron Malakian, who also provides lead vocals on the track. The song received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\"Lonely Day\" features a dreary musical theme with a heavy chorus and a dual guitar solo near the end. The chorus is notable for featuring the double superlative \"most loneliest\".\nThe song is featured in the 2007 film Disturbia, as well as the film's trailer; however, it is not included in the film's soundtrack. Daron did not write the song as a tribute to his brother as rumored, as Daron is an only child.\nThe music video features the band on a tour bus with interspliced shots of Hollywood and sections on fire. About 45 seconds into the video, there is a reference to the Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here album sleeve on a reflected piece of glass. The doodle that bassist Shavo Odadjian is seen to be sketching in the video can be found on his Facebook profile. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/_/Lonely+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
