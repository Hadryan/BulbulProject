This went against the norm where each brother usually sang songs they had written themselves. Later performances of the song were sung by Ray, with Dave providing backing vocals and Eric Clapton influenced guitar solos. Both the Davies brothers continue to perform the song in their solo concerts.\n\nThe song was first released as the B-side to their single \"Sunny Afternoon\" but soon became a favourite and was often part of the Kinks live act. Ray Davies continues to play the song regularly and has been using the song as an opening number in his 2006-2008 solo live appearances.\n\nThe song has been included on many compilations including Sunny Afternoon in the UK in 1967, The Great Lost Kinks Album in the US in 1973 and the 2002 greatest hits release The Ultimate Collection. It also appears as a bonus track on the 1998 CD reissue of Face to Face and the 2011 deluxe edition of The Kink Kontroversy. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks/_/I%27m+Not+Like+Everybody+Else\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
