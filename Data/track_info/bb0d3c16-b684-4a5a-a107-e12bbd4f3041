It is 2 minutes, 48 seconds in length. In the introduction section, there is an innocent childish voice stating, \"Look, mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky!\". This particular section is calm and tranquil initially, but quickly grows more sinister in tone. Shortly after the tone change, the main lyrical section commences. The song bears some similarity to Ummagumma's \"Grantchester Meadows\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Goodbye+Blue+Sky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
