However, there is speculation that he was murdered, as demonstrated in the song. Thom Yorke himself confirmed the song's meaning in several interviews.\n\nA video for the song was released 31 July 2006 and had its first play on Channel 4. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thom+Yorke/_/Harrowdown+Hill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
