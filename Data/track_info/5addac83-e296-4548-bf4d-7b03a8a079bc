Directed by Todd McFarlane in Los Angeles, California, the video explores both animations and live performances mixed together. As a result, the band released a music video that won three awards, and was retired from Total Request Live. With mixed reviews, the single peaked at number six on the Alternative Songs chart, ten on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, and twenty-four on the UK Singles Chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Korn/_/Freak+on+a+Leash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
