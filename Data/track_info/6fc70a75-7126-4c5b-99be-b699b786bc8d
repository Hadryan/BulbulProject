According to Song Facts, Vega said in 1987 on Swedish Television, \"A few years ago, I used to see this group of children playing in from of my building, and there was one of them, whose name was Luka, who seemed a little bit distinctive from the other children. I always remembered his name, and I always remembered his face, and I didn't know much about him, but he just seemed set apart from these other children that I would see playing. And his character is what I based the song Luka on. In the song, the boy Luka is an abused child - In real life I don't think he was. I think he was just different.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Suzanne+Vega/_/Luka\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
