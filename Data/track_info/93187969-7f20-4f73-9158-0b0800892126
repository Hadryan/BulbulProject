The song was released as the first single from that album in the United Kingdom on April 23, 2007.\n\nThe song's promotional video features the band as clerks in a supermarket with Fran Healy as the mascot. When fed up with his job, he goes inside and starts singing on the speaker system. Payne, who was working at the register completely bored, takes out his bass and Dunlop and Primrose are dancing with the customers. When their boss, Ben Stiller in a cameo, hears music, he tries to find out where it comes from but it stops as soon as he looks out of his office. The music then resumes when Stiller goes back to his office. The video ends with the band leaving the supermarket together. The only instrument that appears is Payne's bass, whilst the rest of the band have nothing. The supermarket used in the video is the Super A Foods location #6, at 2245 Yosemite Drive in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles. Fran Healy is seen wearing a Radio Clyde t-shirt that reads \"Radio Clyde 261\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis/_/Closer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
