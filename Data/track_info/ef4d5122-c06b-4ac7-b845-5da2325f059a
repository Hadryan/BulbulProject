The song is a bass-driven ballad with minimal drums and only acoustic guitar. The faint screaming noise at the start of the track is a soundclip from Doctor Who. Its forlorn lyrics complement the music, making it a haunting composition. It reached #5 in the UK singles chart. \"Out of Time\" was Blur's first release for three years and also the band's first release without guitarist Graham Coxon. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/_/Out+of+Time\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Out of Time\" is a song by Blur and was released as the lead single from their seventh album Think Tank in 2003.
