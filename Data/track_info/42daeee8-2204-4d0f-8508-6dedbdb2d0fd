(1999). The song earned Apple a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the 43rd Grammy Awards (2001). \n\nApple wrote \"Paper Bag\" following an experience in which she mistook a paper bag for a dove. The event took place in Los Angeles following recording sessions for her previous studio album, Tidal (1996); Apple, reportedly upset at the time, was a passenger in a car being driven by her father.\n\nAllmusic's Matthew Greenwald described \"Paper Bag\" as having a \"loose, almost ragtime\" melody and rhythm pattern, with an \"up and down\" chord pattern creating a \"funky, looping feel\". The Record noted the \"infectious\" song includes \"Beatlesesque horns\". The Boston Globe classified it as a \"piano ditty\" that \"owes equally to Kurt Weill and Paul McCartney,\" while The Buffalo News noted that it \"provides a more contemporary hip hop sound\" than other songs on her album.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson directed the music video for \"Paper Bag\", which features a blue-and-red palette. Anderson and Apple were in a romantic relationship at the time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/_/Paper+Bag\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
