It is the band's first single of the album for all countries except Austria and Germany, where \"Secrets\" serves as the first single from the new album.\n\nFrontman Ryan Tedder blogged on his MySpace page that before the song's release as a single, the band had already performed it live a lot. He added, \"however the recorded version is quite another animal then what we performed live- it's better, we hope you like it- this might be the most fun energetic song we've ever tackled.\"\n\nA low quality version of the song was published by the band on the 6th September 2009, while a higher quality version of the song can be found on their official Myspace page and official band website.\n\nOn October 8, 2009 the official music video premiered on VH1.com & MTV.com. The video was directed by Wayne Isham. The music video features the band playing on a small stage for the performers of a masquerade ball. They play \"All The Right Moves\" and the dancers perform to this song. Meanwhile, a small boy collects money (and steals) from the dancers as they move around the floor. Around the bridge of the song, Ryan Tedder plays the piano while singing. Although the song and its style are more modern-time, the dancers, background, and the dance they perform is more eighteenth-century-time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/OneRepublic/_/All+the+Right+Moves\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
