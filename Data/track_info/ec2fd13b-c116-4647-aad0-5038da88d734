Although Alice in Chains fared well on mainstream rock radio, \"No Excuses\" is the only Alice in Chains top 50 song and their only song to hit number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\nThe song is featured in the video game Guitar Hero: Metallica.\n\nThe music video for \"No Excuses\" was released in 1994 and was directed by Matt Mahurin, who had previously directed the \"Angry Chair\" music video for the band. The video features actor Max Perlich. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains/_/No+Excuses\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
