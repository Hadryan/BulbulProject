Numerous cover versions have been recorded, and it is one of only nine songs to have hit #1 with versions recorded by two different artists.\n\nWithers' hardscrabble childhood in the coal mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia was the inspiration for \"Lean on Me\", which he wrote after he had moved to Los Angeles and found himself missing the strong community ethic of his hometown. He lived in a house that was broken down and was on the poor side of town.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers/_/Lean+on+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
