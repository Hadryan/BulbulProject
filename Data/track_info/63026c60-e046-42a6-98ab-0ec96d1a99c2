This song was one of the most popular songs of 1997 and is still played on radio today. At the time of its release, it reached the #1 spot on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was also a mainstream Top 40 hit, peaking at #29 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIt is ranked among the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone at #83. The song is noted for carrying a melody almost identical to that heard on The Beatles' \"Lady Madonna\", while the song itself is an adaptation of the track \"Loving\" by Half-Pint. Half-Pint has since performed songs with the Long Beach Dub Allstars, which includes the two surviving members of Sublime. It can be heard on the movie, Fun with Dick and Jane. A shortened, clean version of the song was also included in the video game Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.\n\nThe guitar solo was played by Michael “Miguel” Happoldt, the founder of Skunk Records.\n\nThe song was covered by Michael Franti & Spearhead feat. Gift of Gab on the tribute album Look at All the Love We Found.\n\nThe song contains a sample of the words \"too short\" from \"Life Is... Too Short\" by the American rapper Too Short. The song also contains a sample from a Richard Pryor quote, the same Richard Pryor quote that is used in Ol' Dirty Bastard's Shimmy Shimmy Ya.\n\nThe sentence \"Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest\" is taken from \"Nappy Heads\" by The Fugees. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sublime/_/What+I+Got\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
