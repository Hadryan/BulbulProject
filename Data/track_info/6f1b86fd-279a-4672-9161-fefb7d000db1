The song was released on 8 March 2013, as the lead single from the EP. Lorde and Joel Little co-wrote and produced the song. Musically, \"Royals\" is a minimal and art pop song. Lyrically, it expresses the protagonist's disdain for the lavish lifestyles of music stars.\n\nUpon release \"Royals\" was met with acclaim, and won the 2013 APRA Silver Scroll award, New Zealand's top songwriting prize. Critics placed the track among the year's best. \"Royals\" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached number one in Belgium, Ireland, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, and was certified triple platinum by Recorded Music NZ. In August 2013, Lorde became the first female solo act to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart since Tracy Bonham in 1996. \"Royals\" was the second ever track from a New Zealander to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart – after \"Somebody That I Used To Know\", from Kimbra in collaboration with Australian-Belgian singer Gotye.\n\nJoel Kefali directed the music videos for \"Royals\", the first portrayed ordinary teenagers doing mundane things, in slow motion – an 'international version' followed, additionally featuring short Lorde appearances. The track has been remixed by artists including Rick Ross, The Weeknd, Gilbere Forte, and Pomplamoose.\n\n\"Lately I've been waking up at 4 or 5 a.m., turning things over in my head. So much to think about, so much to break down and process and decide. I'm only at the beginning, but it has always been important to me that everything feels cool, feels right. This song means a hell of a lot to me, and to others, and I guess what I tried to do is make something you could understand. A lot of people think teenagers live in this world like 'skins' every weekend or whatever, but truth is, half the time we aren't doing anything cooler than playing with lighters, or waiting at some shitty stop. That's why this had to be real. And I'm at that particular train station every week. Those boys are my friends.
