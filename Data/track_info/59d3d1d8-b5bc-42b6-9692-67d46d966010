Jack White originally planned for this song to be much softer and done with an acoustic guitar.\n\nThe video for this song, directed by Michel Gondry, depicts Jack White coming back to his and Meg White's trashed house and surveying the destruction. While he goes from room to room, video of the party that led to the destruction, and of his and Meg's relationship before he left, is projected and occasionally super-imposed over the scene.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Dead+Leaves+and+the+Dirty+Ground\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
