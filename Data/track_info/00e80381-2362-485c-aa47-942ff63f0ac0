The version that appears on Dire Straits' greatest hits album, The Very Best of Dire Straits, is 4:55. The On The Night-version contains an extra slide guitar-solo and is 8:55 seconds.\nMark Knopfler usually played the song on a Gibson Les Paul guitar, rather than his usual Schecter \"Stratocaster\", and a Les Paul appears in the distinctive promo video, which is in the style of a charcoal drawing, interspersing scenes of the band playing with scenes of war. During Dire Straits' tour On Every Street 1992, Mark used his Pensa Suhr MK1 for this song, like most of the others.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/_/Brothers+in+Arms\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
