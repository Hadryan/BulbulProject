In the United States, it was released as a radio-only single in advance of the album. \"Pyramid Song\" was the official first single in all other regions, and the \"Pyramid Song\" video was also released worldwide. The song charted at #27 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.\nAlthough the album version is heavily produced by Nigel Godrich and Radiohead, with a more electronic texture, \"I Might Be Wrong\" is one of the more guitar-oriented songs on Amnesiac. The song uses a blues riff written by Jonny Greenwood, in Drop D tuning. The riff is similar to that of the song Loser by the artist Beck who is a friend of Yorke's. The song was first played live as a set-closer in Villa Reale in Milan, Italy, on 19 June 2000, and has become a live favourite. A live version of the song appears on Radiohead's 2001 live album, which is called I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings. It has also often been played in an acoustic version by Thom Yorke. The song was also used in the official commercial ad campaign for the 2002 Winter Olympics. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/I+Might+Be+Wrong\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
