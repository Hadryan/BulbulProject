It hit the radio in February 2009, and became available for purchase online on February 24, 2009. The single was physically released on April 6, 2009.\n\nThe single officially debuted on February 21, 2009, when the band performed at the Echo Awards in Germany. A video from this performance was the most viewed clip on YouTube for the following two days.\n\n\"Wrong\" has received a positive response on United States alternative rock radio, becoming one of the 30 most-played songs in its first week of release. It has received significant airplay from stations such as KCXX, KXRX, WROX-FM, KROQ, WEQX, XTRA, WWCD, CIMX, CFNY-FM, and KVGS.\n\n\"Wrong\" was added to the BBC Radio 6 \"B-List\" playlist for the week starting 7 March 2009. However, a week after physical release in April 2009, it charted at #24, the lowest UK chart position for the initial single from a Depeche Mode studio album (\"Dreaming of Me\", while charting at #57 in 1981, was not an \"official\" track from the Speak & Spell album). By contrast, Sounds of the Universe itself reached #2 in the UK upon release in late April, Depeche Mode's highest album chart position there since 1997. \"Wrong\" went to #1 on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart in the Spring of 2009.\n\nThe B-side \"Oh Well\" (which also appears on the Sounds of the Universe deluxe box set edition) is the first collaboration between Martin Gore (music) and Dave Gahan (lyrics).\n\nThe music video for \"Wrong\" was filmed in December 2008 and directed by Patrick Daughters. It debuted on the band's MySpace page on February 20, 2009. The video depicts a Ford Crown Victoria rolling backwards down a Los Angeles downtown street, seemingly with no driver at the wheel. A shot inside the car reveals a man in a latex mask lying unconscious in the front seat. When the car bumps another car (but keeps rolling), the man is jolted awake. As he tries in desperation to stop the car, it becomes apparent that he is bound and gagged. The car rolls past the band (watching from a sidewalk) and hits a pedestrian, trash cans, and traffic cones. A police vehicle begins pursuing the car. When the man finally manages to free his wrists and remove the mask, a white pickup truck crashes into the side of the car, bringing it to a halt. The bound man in the driving seat, the disturbing latex mask, the crash with a large white vehicle and the overall violent mood evoke parallels to similar elements in the film Surveillance. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/Wrong\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
