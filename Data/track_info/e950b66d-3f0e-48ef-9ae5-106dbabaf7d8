According to the Your Woman Songfacts, Mishra recorded this on an 8-track in his spare room in Derby and played it to his girlfriend, who encouraged him to do something with it. He could only afford to press 5 copies, and he sent one of them to the DJ Simon Mayo at Radio One, who started playing it. It became the most requested track of the week and as a consequence he landed a deal with EMI. It sold 165,000 copies the week it was released shooting to #1 despite his refusal to appear in a video or on British TV to promote it.\n\nYour Woman was inspired by the song My Woman, which was written by ‘Al’ Bowlly, a popular singer in the United Kingdom during the 1930s. He made more than 1,000 recordings between 1927 and 1941. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/White+Town/_/Your+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
