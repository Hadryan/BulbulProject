It also contains references to the September 11 attacks and The Daily Mail. Band frontman Kele Okereke stated in an interview with Jolie Lash:\n\n    The 30 bus in Hackney, which is just around the corner from where I live, was blown up. [That song was] written when I was just observing the reactions of the mainstream press in [the UK] and I was just amazed at how easy it'd been to whip them up into a fury. ... I guess the point about the song for me is post-September 11th, the media has really traded on fear and the use of fear in controlling people.\n\nThe opening of the song features sound portions from news programs into a catchy feel.\n\n\nVideo\n\nThe music video for the song \"Hunting for Witches\" is the most simplistic off the album so far. It simply features the band performing the song in a dark room, using some unique overhead shots in some parts of the video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/_/Hunting+for+Witches\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
