The song was released as the album's second single on October 28, 1994 by Maverick Records. It is a midtempo pop ballad written and produced by Madonna and R&B singer-songwriter Babyface. The song also appears on her compilation albums Something to Remember (1995), GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009).\n\n\"Take a Bow\" received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's soulful, poetic lyrics. The song was a big success in the United States, becoming her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for seven weeks. It was her first single to reach number-one since \"This Used to Be My Playground\" in 1992, and would be her last number-one song in the United States in the 1990s. Elsewhere in the world, the single also had success, reaching number-one in Canada, and the top-ten in Italy, Switzerland and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, it had moderate success, reaching number sixteen on the UK Singles Chart - her first single to miss the top ten there since \"Lucky Star\" peaked at number fourteen nine years earlier.\n\nThe music video for \"Take a Bow\", directed by Michael Haussman, was filmed in Ronda and the bullring of Antequera, Spain. The plot depicts Madonna as a bullfighter's (played by real-life Spanish bullfighter Emilio Mu√±oz) neglected lover, yearning for his unrequited love. The video won Best Female Video at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. In order to promote Bedtime Stories, Madonna performed \"Take a Bow\" live with Babyface at the 1995 American Music Awards and at the 1995 San Remo Festival in Italy. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna/_/Take+a+Bow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
