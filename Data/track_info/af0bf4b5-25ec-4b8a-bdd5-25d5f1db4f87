Its original French refrain is C'est la lutte finale/ Groupons-nous et demain/ L'Internationale/ Sera le genre humain. (Freely translated: \"This is the final struggle/ Let us group together and tomorrow/ The Internationale/ Will be the human race.\") The Internationale has been translated into many of the world's languages. It is sung traditionally with the hand raised in a clenched fist salute. The Internationale is sung not only by communists but also (in many countries) by socialists or social democrats, as well as anarchists.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1944, The Internationale was the de facto national anthem of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe original French words were written in June 1871 by Eugène Pottier (1816–1887, previously a member of the Paris Commune)[1] and were originally intended to be sung to the tune of La Marseillaise.[2] Pierre De Geyter (1848–1932) set the poem to music in 1888.[3] His melody was first publicly performed in July 1888[4] and became widely used soon after.\n\nIn an unsuccessful attempt to save Pierre De Geyter's job as a woodcarver, the 6,000 leaflets printed by Lille printer Bolboduc only mentioned the French version of his family name (Degeyter). In 1904, Pierre's brother Adolphe was induced by the Lille mayor Gustave Delory to claim copyright, so that the income of the song would continue to go to Delory's French Socialist Party. Pierre De Geyter lost the first copyright case in 1914, but after his brother committed suicide and left a note explaining the fraud, Pierre was declared the copyright owner by a court of appeal in 1922.\n\nPierre De Geyter died in 1932. His music of the Internationale is copyrighted in France until October 2017. The duration of copyright in France is 70 years following the end of the year when the author died, plus (for musical works) 6 years and 152 days to compensate for World War I, and 8 years and 120 days to compensate for World War II respectively. Le Chant du Monde, the corporation administering the authors' rights, asked Pierre Merejkowsky, the film director and an actor of Insurrection / résurrection, to pay €1,000 for whistling the song for seven seconds.\n\nHowever, as the Internationale music was published before 1 July 1909 outside the United States of America, it is in the public domain in the USA. Pierre De Geyter's music is also in the public domain in countries and areas whose copyright durations are authors' lifetime plus 75 years or less. As Eugène Pottier died in 1887, his original French lyrics are in the public domain. Gustave Delory once acquired the copyright of his lyrics through the songwriter G B Clement having bought it from Pottier's widow.\n\nGerman translation\n\nThe standard German version by Emil Kondrad Luckhardt (1910), first published by the Arbeiter-Liederbuch für Massen-Gesang of Dortmund, consisting of only three verses. It had however already been written in 1905. It has the record of having been strictly forbidden two days after its publication, in 1910, and again in 1933 when Hitler came to power. Despite of its archaic and often difficult language (a feature this version shares with many other historical versions of the Internationale), it is still the version most commonly sung in all German-speaking countries.\n\nEmil Konrad Luckhardt was born 1880 in Barmen from a worker family. The original lyrics of his German translation are now kept in Wuppertal, in Friedrich Engels' House. Luckhardt died on November 5th, 1914 on an artillery attack in Flanders. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Hannes+Wader/_/Die+Internationale\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
