The song deals with people in the working class and their life. Its blue collar theme resonated with hard rock fans and this newfound popularity led to the album being re-released by Mercury Records in the U.S. Despite its popularity, it has never been released as a single. On the live album All the World's a Stage, the song segues directly into \"Finding my Way\" and one of Neil Peart's drum solos.\n\nThe middle of the song features an extensive instrumental jam with two guitar solos by Alex Lifeson and freestyle bass playing by Geddy Lee. It was voted 94th in Guitar World magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar solos.\n\nTwo versions of the song are available as downloadable tracks for the music video game series Rock Band. One is a cover based on the original recording, while the other is a never before released master track with an alternate guitar solo. The alternate version proved so popular that the band released it on the iTunes Store.\n\nThis song is played in the fourth Supernatural episode, \"Phantom Traveler\".\nThis song is played in the episode \"Get a Real Job\" of the television show, My Name Is Earl.\nThis song is played in an episode of That 70's Show.\nSebastian Bach covered the song on his solo album Bach 2: Basics. \nThe song was the title for the season four finale of the Trailer Park Boys. In the episode, Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles hijack Rita MacNeil's tour bus and force them to harvest their Cannabis fields at gunpoint. While harvesting, Rita and the rest of her band begin to sing \"Working Man\" (which Rita McNeil famously covered), much to the annoyance of Ricky.\nAudioslave covered this song live\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rush/_/Working+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
