The example I use is the global warming issue. I think it's really important issue, but I also think that people should do something about it because they want to and they feel passionate, not because the government say you must stop driving or you must stop flying. I don't think that works.”\n\nLyrics:\n\nTell me why this world is a mess\nI thought you always tried your best\nTell me what I’m out to do\nMaybe you should do it too\n\nTell me why they’re sleeping alone\nNo house no where to call a home\nTell me what I’m meant to see\nWon’t you stop preaching at me\n\nAnd I wanna see what it’s all about\nAnd I wanna live, wanna give something back\nDon’t tell me that it’s over\nIt’s only just begun\nDon’t tell me that it’s over\nOr that this song is sung\nThe song is sung\n\nAll the money in the world\nWould never slit all the wrongs to right\nAll the fire in the world\nWould never set my heart alive\n\nI dream of a day when it’s all gone away\nAnd the sun is shining bright\nI dream of a day when it’s all gone away\nBut dreams are for night\n\nAnd I wanna see what it’s all about\nAnd I wanna live, wanna give something back\nDon’t tell me that it’s over\nIt’s only just begun\nDon’t tell me that it’s over\nOr that this song is sung\nThe song is sung\n\nDon’t tell that it’s over\nPlease I’m on my knees I’m beggin you to stop\nIt’s over please I’m on my knees I’m beggin you to stop\n\nAnd I wanna see what it’s all about\nAnd I wanna live, wanna give something back\nDon’t tell me that it’s over\nIt’s only just begun\nDon’t tell me that it’s over\nOr that this song is sung\nThe song is sung\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Macdonald/_/Don%27t+Tell+Me+That+It%27s+Over\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
