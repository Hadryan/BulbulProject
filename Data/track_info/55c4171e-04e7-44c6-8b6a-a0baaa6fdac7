Bob Stanley says \"We played it to the label and they said, you've gotta stick that out as a single. It's pretty cheesy. It's meant to sound like Herman's Hermits, a joke song - which ended up being our biggest hit. A millstone. We wrote it in about ten minutes. We were in a big A-ha phase, and we thought it was going to sound like Cry Wolf. Sarah Cracknell commented \"It was supposed to be a joke, but Alan McGee said \"Brilliant! Got to be an a-side!\" And it was our biggest hit\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Saint+Etienne/_/You%27re+In+A+Bad+Way\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
