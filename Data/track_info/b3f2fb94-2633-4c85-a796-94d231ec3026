It was remixed in 1990, which itself was released as a single, peaking at #13 on the UK singles chart.\n\nThere are two versions of \"Close to Me\", one with a brass section and one without. The version without the brass section is the original album version on The Head on the Door while the version with brass instruments is a remix that was released as a single and appears on Staring at the Sea: the Singles. The instrumental brass section appearing on the single versions is actually adapted from a traditional New Orleans funeral march. The 12\" extended mix contains an extended arrangement of the brass section, featuring original material not found on other versions. The versions with brass instruments also include a long creaking sound of a door closing at the beginning. This sound comes from the beginning of the music video that was shot for \"Close to Me\", which features the band trapped in a wardrobe that is falling off of a cliff into an ocean. The lyrics contain the words \"If only I was sure/that my head on the door was a dream\", which inspired the title for the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Close+to+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
