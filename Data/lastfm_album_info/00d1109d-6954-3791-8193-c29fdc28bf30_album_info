This is apparent in the lack of slap bass and guitar palm muting, which can only slightly be found in \"Out From Under\". The drums are also quieter as just a single pedal is used, this is again heard on later releases. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Incubus/Make+Yourself\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
