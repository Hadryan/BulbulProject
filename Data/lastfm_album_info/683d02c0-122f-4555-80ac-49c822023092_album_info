On 3 April 2008, Harris stated that the only existing copy of his upcoming album work was lost when his laptop was misplaced during the baggage handling problems at the opening of London Heathrow Terminal 5. He later stated on the BBC's Glastonbury Festival 2008 coverage that he got his baggage back including the album within a few days. Harris recently admitted however that this was an \"untruth\" as the album was not in his luggage at all, and that he hoped the lie would buy him some more time to finish recording the LP. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Calvin+Harris/Ready+for+the+Weekend\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
