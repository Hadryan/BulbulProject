Sam Loeffler stated, \"We have spent a lot of time making these songs something different from past records without losing the core of our passion.

The album was praised by Jared Johnson of Allmusic for taking a step in a new direction in regards to the lyrics. Pete Loeffler normally wrote lyrics about personal subjects, however on Sci-Fi Crimes, he wrote of stories including apparitions, conspiracy theories, and erratic sleeping conditions. The tour following the release of Sci-Fi Crimes was in the Fall of 2009. Opening for Chevelle on this tour was Halestorm, Adelitas Way, and After Midnight Project. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chevelle/Sci-Fi+Crimes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
