The album became the band's first UK #1 album, and although their debut album was relatively successful in the USA, going platinum and reaching #32, You Could Have It So Much Better managed to reach #8 and earned gold status in the States. The cover design is modeled on Alexander Rodchenko's 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Ferdinand/You+Could+Have+It+So+Much+Better\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
