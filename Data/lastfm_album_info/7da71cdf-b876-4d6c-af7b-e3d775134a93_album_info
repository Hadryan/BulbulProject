Two singles were released from the album - \"She Moves She\" which featured a sample from The Neptune Collection by The Entourage Music And Theater Ensemble and \"As Serious as Your Life\"), as well as one EP, My Angel Rocks Back and Forth. The latter features remixes of the title track by Isambard Khroustaliov and electronica duo Icarus, two new Four Tet tracks, and a DVD of all of Four Tet's music videos for Pause and Rounds. A promotional version of the album was issued in March 2003. The only track different from the version on the final release is \"Unspoken\", which originally featured an alternate piano melody sampled from the Tori Amos song \"Winter\". Because Amos' record company refused to clear the sample, a new melody was improvised for the official release of Rounds. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Four+Tet/Rounds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
