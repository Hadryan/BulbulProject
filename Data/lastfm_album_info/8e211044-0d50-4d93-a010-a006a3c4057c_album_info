On listening to the 12 songs that comprise Philharmonics, some of these influences can be distinctly heard. Although folk music features all the way through Obel’s compositions, it is the sparse atmospheric sound that is predominant. Obel writes, performs and produces everything herself. She studied the piano from an early age and was taught by her mother.\n\nThere are three instrumental numbers on this album. The first, Falling, Catching is purely piano solo and immediately Satie springs to mind. The clashing harmonies are pure Bartok and the falling melody is reflected in the title of the song. Loretta combines synth and keyboard sounds with the piano and is characterized by a few simple chords and Wallflower has an ethereal lilting quality combining solo cello with piano.\n\nThe remaining numbers are all vocal. Obel has a breathy, light voice which is suited to this kind of minimalist style. Many of the songs are multitracked so that Obel is able to produce   interesting vocal harmonies. Brother Sparrow and Just So use both piano and guitar accompaniments, both have pretty lilting melodies. Avenue and Over the Hill combine simple chordal harmonies with breathy reflective vocal lines. The album title, Philharmonics uses strong minor chords providing an emotional element which mimics the lyrics. Some songs employ brush drums and many synth combinations as well as the piano adding richer textures to the sound. More upbeat numbers are On Powdered Ground and Beast. However, most of the songs are slow, atmospheric and could be effectively used as a film soundtrack. Indeed Riverside has already been successfully used in the 2010 film, Submarino and also in the TV show, Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nTracklist:\n01 – Falling Catching\n02 – Riverside\n03 – Brother Sparrow\n04 – Just So\n05 – Beast\n06 – Louretta\n07 – Avenue\n08 – Philharmonics\n09 – Close Watch\n10 – Wallflower\n11 – Over the Hill\n12 – On Powdered Ground <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Agnes+Obel/Philharmonics\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
