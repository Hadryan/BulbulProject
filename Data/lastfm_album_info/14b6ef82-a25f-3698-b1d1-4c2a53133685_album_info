It’s a telling statement; self-effacing, sure, but not without a grain of truth – a tacit acknowledgement that the music Eirik Bøe and Erlend Øye make isn’t the kind to offend millions, move mountains, part oceans. No, it’s lovely, pretty, well crafted; it’s nice. And sometimes, well, that’s just plenty. Declaration of dependence's title aims to set right the bad press ‘dependence’ often receives, reflecting the fruitful working relationship the duo share. More than that, it also addresses the perils of the modern age: the plethora of options and opportunity surrounding us that threatens to engulf and consume as much as it does amuse and enlighten.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kings+of+Convenience/Declaration+of+Dependence\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
