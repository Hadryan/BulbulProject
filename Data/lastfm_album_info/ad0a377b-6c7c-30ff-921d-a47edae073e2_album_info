The album features contributions from De La Soul, Neneh Cherry, Martina Topley-Bird, Roots Manuva, MF DOOM, Ike Turner, Bootie Brown of the Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder, Dennis Hopper, the London Community Gospel Choir and the San Fernando Valley Youth Chorus.\n\nDemon Days entered the UK charts at #1 and the U.S. charts at #6, outperforming the band's 2001 debut, Gorillaz. The album had sold over six million copies as of 2006. The album features the singles \"Feel Good Inc.\", \"DARE\", \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Kids with Guns\" / \"El Mañana\".\n\n\n\nAlbum information\nDemon Days was first mentioned in articles detailing the reopening of Gorillaz' website in early December 2004. Initially, a March or April 2005 release date was announced, but it was later pushed back. In an article for Q magazine in February 2005 it was reported that the album was to be titled We Are Happy Landfill. Another early title was reported to be Reject False Icons, which is also the title of Gorillaz' culture jamming project.\n\nIn January 2005 a promo for the song \"Dirty Harry\" was released as a white label 12\" and an exclusive video was released online entitled \"Rock It\". It was later reported that the track would not appear on the album, although it later appeared on D-Sides, a collection of remixes, rare songs and B-sides released in November 2007.\n\nDemon Days' lead single \"Feel Good Inc.\" became Gorillaz' biggest hit (UK #2, US #14, US-Modern Rock #1) at the time. The album's second single, \"DARE\" featuring Shaun Ryder, became a big hit as well, giving the band their first #1 single in the UK. Since its release, Demon Days has been certified double platinum in the U.S. and 5 times platinum in the UK.\n\nThe album cover is a reference to Let It Be by The Beatles and resembles the Blur: The Best Of artwork, the greatest hits album by Albarn's first band Blur.\n\nThis album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.\n\nA limited edition of the album was released in a special digipak gatefold, allowing the owner to choose which band member is on the cover. It also contains an exclusive booklet, with lyrics and illustrations for each song, a DVD containing the video (with audio commentary), an animatic for the music video \"Feel Good Inc.\", short animated films featuring the band, an exclusive audio track titled \"The Swagga\" and online access to exclusive sections of the band's website, with various wallpapers and screensavers, as well as a crowbar, facilitating the opening of a locked cupboard in the kitchen on Gorillaz.com in order to download the song \"Happy Landfill\".\n\n\n Marketing\n\n Reject False Icons\nThe phrase 'Reject False Icons' was first mentioned on 24 November 2004 on a Gorillaz mail out to fans. On 8 December, the Gorillaz website was re-opened with a brand new music video, \"Rock It\", which has the saying \"Reject False Icons\" at the end. On 19 December the 'Reject False Icons' campaign kicked off with the launch of rejectfalseicons.com. Fans could submit their photos of ways to spread the message by using graffiti or by sticking 'Reject False Icons' stickers that were available for a limited period from the site and from selected record shops in the UK. It was first Respect False Icons, but Albarn changed it to Reject False Icons. Noodle said it is both 'Respect' and 'Reject'.\n\n\nSearch for a Star\nIn December 2004, the Gorillaz launched their own talent contest, Search for a Star, to find an artist to collaborate with.[7] There were on average over 100 entries per week whittled down to around 10 to be put forward for the public vote. The 200+ entries were viewed over a million times. A gallery room was added to Kong Studios which displayed all of the entries. Originally, Gorillaz' competition, was initially run to pick just one winner from entries submitted to Gorillaz.com. However, at the end of the competition, it was announced that two further entries—one from the submitted images, and one from the submitted audio files—would be chosen by online vote.\n\nThe winners for each entries are as followed:\n\nVideo: \"Table Manners\" by Carlos \"Sourbee\" Sowerby \nAudio: \"Indian Dance\" by Danny \"Asidus\" Gonzalez \nImage: \"2D and Paula\" by Irina \"Schneeflocke\" Bolshakova ( www.schneef.com ) \nAll three collaborated on the fourth single release of Phase Two, \"Kids With Guns\" / \"El Mañana\". Sourbee provided his animated incarnation of the \"Don't Get Lost In Heaven (Original Demo Version)\" B-side, featured on the DVD version of the single. Asidus made a \"Dirty Harry\" remix called \"Uno Quatro\" featured on the Gorillaz website. Schneeflocke created her own artistic interpretation of \"El Mañana\", featured on an insert included on the DVD version of the single.\n\n\nReception\nSpin (p.64) - Ranked #4 in Spin's \"40 Best Albums Of 2005\" - \"[A] vivid, spastic concept album about the last primates to survive the apocalypse\" - \nSpin (p.105) - \"Albarn still has great taste in other people's music.
