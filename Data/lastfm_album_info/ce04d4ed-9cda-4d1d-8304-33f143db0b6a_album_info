It was his last solo album before adding The Innocent Criminals to his line-up. Reviews were generally very positive, praising Harper's fusion of multiple genres, from Folk (\"Another Lonely Day\"), folk rock (\"Gold to Me\"), Black Sabbath-style riffing heavy metal (\"Ground on Down\") and politically-charged reggae (\"Excuse Me Mister\").\n\nAfter Harper's well-received debut, Welcome to the Cruel World, he expanded on his fanbase by touring relentlessly with jam bands like Dave Matthews Band. On this, his second album, Harper added a more refined sense of his own intense spirituality, such as on the gospel-influenced album closers, \"Power of the Gospel\", \"God Fearing Man\" and \"One Road to Freedom\".\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Ben Harper except as noted.\n\n   1. \"Oppression\" 2:58\n   2. \"Ground on Down\" – 4:53\n   3. \"Another Lonely Day\" – 3:43\n   4. \"Please Me Like You Want To\" – 4:55\n   5. \"Gold to Me\" – 5:00\n   6. \"Burn One Down\" – 3:31\n   7. \"Excuse Me Mr.\" (Harper, Plunier) – 5:24\n   8. \"People Lead\" – 4:13\n   9. \"Fight for Your Mind\" – 4:06\n  10. \"Give a Man a Home\" – 3:35\n  11. \"By My Side\" – 3:34\n  12. \"Power of the Gospel\" – 6:02\n  13. \"God Fearing Man\" – 11:49\n  14. \"One Road to Freedom\" – 4:14\n\nArtwork\n\nThe Fight For Your Mind artwork features the use of military roundels from African nations (plus Jamaica) to represent each track on the album.
