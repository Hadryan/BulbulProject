On July 29th 1998, the RIAA certified it 16.00× Multi-Platinum.\n\nIt was the second-best-selling album of the 1990s, behind Shania Twain's Come on Over, with twenty-eight million copies sold by 2000. By January 2005, the album had sold 30 million units worldwide.\n\nIn October 2002, Rolling Stone ranked it number 31 on its Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alanis+Morissette/Jagged+Little+Pill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
