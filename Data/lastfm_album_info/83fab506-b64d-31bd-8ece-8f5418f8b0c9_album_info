Included is possibly the group's biggest hit, \"Bull in the Heather.\" Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre appears in the music video for this song. Lee Ranaldo did not write or sing any songs on this album.\n\nChart Performance\n\nThe album peaked at #34 on the Billboard 200 chart. Previously, the band's best performance on that chart was Dirty, which reached #89. To date, this is their highest peak on the US charts. The album has sold 242,000 copies in the US according to Soundscan.\n\nCancelled single\n\n\"Self-Obsessed and Sexxee\" was intended to be the second single from this album. A promo CD was issued, but plans for a regular release were cancelled and promo pressing ceased. The remaining copies were sold off through Sonic Death. The CD included the same b-sides as \"Bull in the Heather.\"\n\nNotes\n\n\"Screaming Skull\" is about the band's nostalgia for their days on independent labels, particularly SST Records, which is mentioned frequently throughout the song, along with the label's \"Superstore\" in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Doctor's Orders\" is sung by Kim Gordon on the album. The \"Bull in the Heather\" single contains an alternate version with Thurston Moore singing.\n\nTo save tape costs, the band recorded over the master tapes of Sister. When the volume of the album is turned up, especially in between tracks, one can hear Sister being played in its entirety. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Youth/Experimental+Jet+Set,+Trash+And+No+Star\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
