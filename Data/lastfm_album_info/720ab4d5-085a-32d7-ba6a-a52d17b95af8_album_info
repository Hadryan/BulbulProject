The album was produced in conjunction with Nellee Hooper, Tricky, Graham Massey of 808 State, and electronic music producer Howie B. Building on the success of her previous album Debut, Björk continued to pursue different sounds, taking particular interest in dance and techno. Production by Tricky and Howie B also provided trip hop-like sounds on tracks like \"Possibly Maybe\". It was these producers' influence that gave Björk impetus to create material like the storming \"Army of Me\" and \"Enjoy\".However, Björk had not lost her old fascination with Hollywood-style numbers. Her cover of the Betty Hutton track \"Blow a Fuse\", retitled \"It's Oh So Quiet\", became one of Björk's most well-known moments. After \"Army of Me\" reached the UK top 10, and the subsequent release of \"Isobel\" (which did less well), One Little Indian scheduled \"It's Oh So Quiet\" as a novelty Christmas hit. To their surprise, it reached number four in December 1995; it was even later spoofed by The Smurfs. Despite Björk later disowning the song[citation needed], the commercial attention led to her subsequent single releases \"Hyperballad\" and \"Possibly Maybe\" charting higher than expected.Much material was produced during the album's genesis in 1994, including \"I Go Humble\", which would later be released as a B-side. Many of the vocals were recorded in Nassau, Bahamas by Compass Point Studios with Björk standing well out into the ocean at sunset. The vocal for \"Cover Me\" was originally recorded in a nearby bat-infested cave, but was replaced in favour of the studio version. The original version of this song is found on Family Tree, a box set of rare, previously unreleased material.\n\nPost eventually went to number two on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Björk's second biggest seller there after Debut. A remix album, Telegram, soon followed and Björk was now officially Iceland's biggest musical export.\n\nPost has been certified platinum in the U.S.\n\nThe original cover featured Björk surrounded by silver balls with her tongue extended towards a falling silver ball. It was shot by Jean Baptiste Mondino, who did the sleeve for Debut. The cover was later scrapped, and re-shot by Stéphane Sednaoui. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/Post\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
