The album was released against the will of Roger Waters.\n\nThe title is facetious, given that Pink Floyd is not known for making particularly danceable music. This is perhaps evidenced by the album art, which featured a photograph of ballroom dancers guyed to the ground so they cannot move. The Hipgnosis design team did the cover under the pseudonym TCP after falling out with Roger Waters a few years earlier. The inner sleeve had pictures of dancers in either a white (UK) or black (U.S.) background. The picture labels were a black background with blue lines and red sketch lined dancers on side one and reverse on side two.\n\nThe album contains alternate mixes of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" (which comprises parts 1, 2, 4 and 7) and \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\" (which combines the intro from the single mix with the album version which fades out during the \"if you don't eat your meat\" ending). Also, the track \"Money\" was re-recorded as Capitol Records refused to let Columbia Records in the U.S. use the track. David Gilmour re-recorded the track himself playing all of the drums, guitars, keyboards, bass guitar and vocals and co-producing the song with James Guthrie. Dick Parry reprised his saxophone role on the track. There are some slight differences between the re-recorded version and original, mainly in certain sections of the saxophone and guitar solos. The drumming is noticeably different from Nick Mason's.\n\nThe album was certified Gold by the RIAA on 29 January 1982 and Platinum on 6 July 1989 and Double Platinum in August, 2001. The album reached #37 on the UK charts and #31 in the U.S.. Columbia issued the remastered CD in 1997 in the U.S. and most of the world save Europe. Then a 1997 remastered CD was re-released in 2000 on Capitol Records in the U.S. and EMI for the rest of the world including Europe. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/A+Collection+Of+Great+Dance+Songs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
