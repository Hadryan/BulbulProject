Shades of Blue isn't just a Blue Note cover album, it's a re-imagination of the Blue Note culture.\n\nMadlib draws from the label's music catalog, of course, but also its influence through the years, its history as a prestigious jazz house, the iconography associated with the label and its import on its own.\n\nMadlib covers some of his favorite songs from the Blue Note collection, which he cites as being influential to his development. \"People say Blue Note was just a phase in hip-hop,\" Madlib explains, referring to the era when groups like A Tribe Called Quest and Gang Starr would sample the label's sounds. \"But music is either good music or bad music and I still listen to Blue Note. I still love it.\"\n\nSome tracks like Donald Byrd's \"Steppin' Into Tomorrow\" are longtime favorites of his, and he considered their inclusion in this project as a no-brainer. On that song, Madlib gives an already funky tune a voluptuous hip-hop bump. On \"Please Set Me At Ease,\" Madlib rigs a Bobbi Humphrey song into a groovy, soulful beat for rapper Medaphor to rhyme over. Horace Silver's \"Song For My Father\" was more personal. Not only has it been an everlasting favorite but he says it's his dedication to his own father, notable 70s soul singer, Otis Jackson, Sr.\n\nShades of Blue also includes a new song, \"Funky Blue Note,\" that Madlib conceived as his ode to his favorite era of the label â€“ the 1960s and 1970s. \"I just wanted to show my side of understanding the music and bringing the same kind of sound,\" he says. \"That's the sound I like from Blue Note. You were just free to do whatever ideas you wanted to do.\"\n\nThe convergence of Madlib and Blue Note on this special project transcends the legacies and reputations of both entities. It's a special convocation. Alfred Lion and Francis Wolf would be proud.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Madlib/Shades+of+Blue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
