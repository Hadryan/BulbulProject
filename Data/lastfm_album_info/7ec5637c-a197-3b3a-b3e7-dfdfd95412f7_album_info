Its sheer audacity , at a time when everything in the charts had succumbed to formulaic manufactured pop was simply breathtaking. The performance of My Death on network T.V. alienated what was left of his fan base and consigned him to virtual oblivion for 20yrs. The albums Scott1,2,3 and 4 are now recognised ,by adherents at least , a testament to a singular genius never likely to be reproduced.
