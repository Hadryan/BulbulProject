The \"retrospective collection\" is an 18-track double album with the featured songs chosen by Noel Gallagher; however, it does not actually include their song Stop The Clocks after which the album is named. It went 4x platinum in the UK with sales better than any album there since Be Here Now.\n\nThe album came about due to the end of Oasis' recording contract with Sony BMG Music Entertainment. Noel Gallagher has gone on record before on numerous occasions saying that Oasis wouldn't release a greatest hits album unless the band were about to split up. However, in an interview with news.com.au in December 2005, he hinted that Sony were planning to release one anyway, and that despite his misgivings, he would have to get involved with it otherwise it'd be bad. This was clarified in September 2006, when he told the NME that when he made it clear to Sony that the band were not going to re-sign to them, the record label decided to release a greatest hits album. Gallagher then explained that he insisted that it had to be a 'best-of' because he felt a compilation of the best singles, album tracks and b-sides would produce a stronger album than a compilation of singles.\n\nTo address some fans' concerns that the release of a greatest hits album was a sign that the band were about to finish, based on some of Noel Gallagher's previous comments, the press release for the album confirmed that they are merely taking \"a well earned sabbatical prior to starting work on new material, destined for similar levels of success in the future. As such, this is not a full stop, but merely a time out; a dream set list, and a chance for the world to review the immense contribution that Oasis have made and continue to make to rock 'n' roll.\"\n\nGallagher stated in an episode of MTV's Gonzo that the album would be more for future generations, as Gallagher himself became interested in artists such as The Beatles through compilation albums.\n\nTo celebrate the release of the album, the band unveiled their first full-length film - Lord Don't Slow Me Down, shot during the Don't Believe the Truth world tour, from May 2005 to March 2006, the film was shown in November 2006 around the world in selected picture houses, theatres and cinemas to winners of fans competitions and the press. It was also broadcasted on Channel 4 in the UK.\n\nThe album debuted at number two in the UK charts selling over 50,000 copies in its first day of release and 216,000 in its first week of release, surprisingly not selling enough to knock off the top spot to The Love Album, by the boy-band Westlife. It also debuted at number 89 on the U.S. Billboard 200, starting with 18,000 units sold. It did however enter the Japanese Oricon album charts at number one, selling 87,462 copies in its first week. The album has sold over around 2.5 million copies worldwide(1.2 million alone in the UK).\n\nIn Japan, a box set was also released of all their singles to coincide with the album.\n\nStop the Clocks focuses heavily on the band's most popular albums, Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory ?, with each contributing five tracks, plus four B-sides (also included on the band's other compilation album The Masterplan) from this era. Only two tracks appear from Don't Believe the Truth, and one track each from Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and Heathen Chemistry, whilst Be Here Now is ignored completely.\n\nWhen the release of Stop the Clocks was first announced in July 2006, speculation was rife that the unreleased song of the same name would be included on the record as a bonus track. However, Noel Gallagher told fans at a Q&A session that the song was considered for inclusion, but they weren't happy with any of the many versions they have recorded.\n\nGallagher also confirmed that the title was chosen to sum up what was described in the initial press release as being \"merely a time out; a chance for the world to review the immense contribution that Oasis have made and continue to make to rock 'n' roll.\" Noel Gallagher revealed in an interview in April 2005 that 'Stop the Clocks' was the original title for the band's early recorded material in early 2004, which turned eventually into Don't Believe the Truth.\n\nGallagher revealed to Billboard that he was approached about including some new songs on the album as well, but that he opted not to \"because it takes the focus away from what you're actually trying to say with a retrospective.\"\n\nGallagher told the NME in September 2006 that he picked the tracks on the album, and there were about eight songs that \"should be on there, but aren't\". He explained that his original vision was for a 12-track album on one CD, but, after whittling down from an initial 30+ tracks, the track-listing was finalised. He admitted that he's had arguments with people about the tracklisting but that \"someone has to pick the tracklisting, and I've picked it and that's the end of it. But that must mean we're pretty good, if people are arguing about what's not on it, it's brilliant!\"\n\nDuring an interview on Radio 1 in October 2006, and later during a question and answer session with The Sun, Liam Gallagher, who got a songwriting credit with his \"Songbird\", claimed that he was happy with the tracks Noel had selected for the album, although he said that he would have liked \"Rockin' Chair\" and \"D'You Know What I Mean?\" to be included. Noel, however, admitted that \"D'You Know What I Mean?\" was to be included on the album up until the moment it was being mastered, explaining that the length of the song \"upset the flow of the album\". \n\nSongs that the band also wanted to be on the track listing were \"Cast No Shadow\", \"Gas Panic!\", Whatever and \"Little By Little\" , although they couldn't fit them in since they felt the record would \"drag on\" and make it too long, being over the some 18-track idea Noel had planned out. Noel has also said he would have liked to have found a place for \"Fade Away\", \"(It's Good) To Be Free\", Let There Be Love\" and \"Listen Up\".\n\nIn the special boxed-edition of 'Stop the Clocks' at the end of the 'Lock the Box' interview, when Liam was told 'Whatever' was not on the track-listing he said \"Thank fuck for that\".\n\nA Japanese special edition, released the following year, has a variety of B-sides scanning the latter years of the Gallaghers output, including \"Eyeball Tickler\" and \"Lets's All Make Believe\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Stop+the+Clocks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
