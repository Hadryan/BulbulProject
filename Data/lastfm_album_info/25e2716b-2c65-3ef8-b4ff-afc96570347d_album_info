The album was released on 28 June 2004 by Geffen Records. Initial pressings included a bonus DVD containing a documentary of the conception of three songs from the album, titled Making The Cure. The Cure continues the pattern of a studio release by The Cure once every four years, preceded by Wish in 1992, Wild Mood Swings in 1996 and Bloodflowers in 2000, and followed by 4:13 Dream in 2008. The Cure was co-produced by Ross Robinson, who has previously worked with bands such as Korn, Vanilla Ice, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, At the Drive-In, Glassjaw and The Blood Brothers. This may explain why the songs on the album are significantly heavier than previous material by the band. Frontman Robert Smith has described the record as \"Cure heavy\", as opposed to \"new-metal heavy\". According to the liner notes, the entire album was recorded live in the studio.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/The+Cure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
