The album was recorded throughout 2008 and is produced by Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania. Xenomania also co-wrote three of the tracks. Guitarist Johnny Marr and string arranger Owen Pallett appear as well. \"Love etc.\" was released on 16 March 2009 as the album's lead single.\n\nYes debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart on sales of 27,639 copies, the duo's highest-placing album since Bilingual (1996). Early sales figures predicted that the album would enter at number one, but its release was beset by distribution problems and Yes proved unable to hold onto its midweek position. The download version erroneously went on sale through iTunes three days before its official release date, rendering 2,500 sales ineligible for the chart, while, the following week, a number of suppliers of the physical album reported stock level problems. The album was hit by a minor manufacturing error as well: some booklets included with initial copies of the Yes etc. double CD set were stapled in the wrong order. EMI set up a website for anyone affected by this to claim a new booklet.\n\nThe album was released in multiple formats, including a digital version that included a 48-minute track-by-track commentary on the album, and an 11-disc vinyl version limited to 300 copies, with each disc containing a different album track on the first side and a corresponding instrumental version on the second. The double CD edition of the album incorporated a bonus disc titled Etc., which featured mostly instrumental dub mixes of six album tracks, as well as a new song called \"This Used to Be the Future\", to which Philip Oakey of The Human League contributed some vocals. A standard, single-disc vinyl LP was also issued, but did not coincide with the international CD and download release.\n\nYes spawned three further singles. On 1 June 2009, \"Did You See Me Coming?\" was released worldwide on a number of physical and digital formats, backed with three new B-sides. A limited German-only \"Beautiful People\" CD and download followed in October. Pet Shop Boys' first EP release, the five-track Christmas set, was released on 14 December 2009, with \"All Over the World\" acting as the principal radio promo.\n\nThe album was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 2010 Grammy Awards.\n\nYes was supported by a comprehensive world tour that stretched across 2009â€“2012. A recording of the tour made in London in December 2009 was released in a CD/DVD package on 15 February 2010 as Pandemonium.\n\nThe album sleeve was designed by Mark Farrow and Pet Shop Boys. The tick on the cover is made up of eleven coloured squares. It was inspired by German artist Gerhard Richter (who is referenced in the album's opening track, \"Love etc.\"), specifically his 4900 exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery and the stained glass window in Cologne Cathedral.\n\nThe album's cover was nominated in the 2010 Brit Insurance Design Awards shortlist in the Graphics category. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pet+Shop+Boys/Yes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
