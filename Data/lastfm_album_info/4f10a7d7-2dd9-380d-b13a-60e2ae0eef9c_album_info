The album's sound, inspired by surf and space rock, complements its lyrical focus on outer space, which references subjects such as aliens and unidentified flying objects.\n\nBecause of 4AD's independent status, major label Elektra Records handled distribution in the United States; however, Bossanova only reached #70 on the Billboard 200. It charted significantly higher in the United Kingdom, reaching #3 in the Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Bossanova, Velouria and Dig for Fire both charted highly on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pixies/Bossanova\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
