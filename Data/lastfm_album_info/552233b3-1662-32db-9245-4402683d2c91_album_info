The album's lyrics are heavily influenced by Mayan Civilization. The CD was released with copy control on it. This CD started a new \"saga\", called A New Age Dawns. This saga is continued on the album Design Your Universe.\n\nStylistically, the album is more focused towards orchestration than other Epica releases and features heavy use of a chorus. Additionally, Mark Jansen's death growls appear less frequently, occurring on only three songs, \"Force of the Shore\", \"Mother of Light\" and \"Consign to Oblivion\". But a bonus track, the Death cover \"Crystal Mountain\" includes grunts and a grunt version of \"Quietus\" was released on the \"Quietus (Silent Reverie)\" single, making it five songs with grunts. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Epica/Consign+to+Oblivion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
