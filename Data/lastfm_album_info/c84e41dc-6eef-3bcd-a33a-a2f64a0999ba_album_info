The album title comes from the Fourth Crusade and the capturing of Constantinople. The cover artwork is a painting from Eugène Delacroix, showing \"The Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople\".\n\nFor this album Bolt Thrower slowed down considerably compared to War Master, focussing more on playing heavy riffs and a thick sound. Album feature more death/doom metal-driven style, and which was influenced by doom metal bands including Candlemass and Black Sabbath. Particularly, this style, is apparent in songs like \"This Time It's War\", or \"As the World Burns\".\n\n\"Embers\" opens and ends as \"Cenotaph\" did on the previous album War Master, and leads into \"Powder Burns\" on Mercenary. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bolt+Thrower/The+IVth+Crusade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
