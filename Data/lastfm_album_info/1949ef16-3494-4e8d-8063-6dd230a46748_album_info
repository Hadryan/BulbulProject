It is the longest of the band's three albums.\n\nThe album's sound differed from Dummy, the main differences being that much of the music was composed and recorded by the band, then pressed to vinyl. This created a grainy, harsher sound. Three singles, \"All Mine,  \"Over\" and \"Only You\" were released, the first one achieving a Top 10 placing in the UK.\n\n\"All Mine\" was later covered by Tom Jones and The Divine Comedy,\n\n\"Mourning Air\" had previously appeared on The Help Album\n\n\"Only You\" was later released in a promotional French language lyrics version. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Portishead/Portishead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
