The Doors credit the success of their first album to being able to work the songs out night after night at the Whisky a Go Go or the London Fog. \"Alabama Song\" was originally written and composed by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill for their opera Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny (Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny); \"Back Door Man\" was a Howlin' Wolf cover. \"The End\"'s Oedipal climax was first performed live at the Whisky A Go Go and The Doors were thrown out as a result of lead vocalist Jim Morrison screaming \"Mother...I want to fuck you!\" near the climax of the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Doors/The+Doors\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
