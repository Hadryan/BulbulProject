It was released September 24, 2007 on Peacefrog Records in the UK and Imperial Recordings in Sweden. It was released September 25, 2007 by Mute Records in the United States. The album's lyrical thrust centers around the human condition, or the nature that the title refers to. Though the sonic palette remains based around classical guitar and vocal melody, as in his debut Veneer, it is occasionally expanded. Hand claps, backing vocals and synthesizer are some notable additions. In Sweden, the first single was \"Killing for Love\", whereas in the rest of Europe it was \"Down the Line\". Both singles came with the same B-side, a cover of \"Smalltown Boy\" by Bronski Beat. The second single released was \"Teardrop\" (backed with the exclusive instrumental B-side \"Four Forks Ache\"), and the third single was another split--\"Killing for Love\" in the UK, and \"Down the Line\" in Sweden. Both singles came with the same B-side \"Neon Lights\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jos%C3%A9+Gonz%C3%A1lez/In+Our+Nature\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
