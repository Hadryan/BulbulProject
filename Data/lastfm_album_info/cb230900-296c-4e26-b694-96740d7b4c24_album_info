This album consists of a collection of previously unreleased material by way of remixed songs from Tupac's \"Makaveli\" period while signed to Death Row Records, and was produced by Johnny \"J\", Jazze Pha, Frank Nitty, and E.D.I. of Outlawz. Tracks include \"My Block (remix)\", \"When We Ride on Our Enemies\", \"Catchin' Feelins\" and \"Never Call U Bitch Again\". It also includes \"Military Minds\" which features Boot Camp Clik members Buckshot and Smif-n-Wessun (credited as Cocoa Brovaz) which was supposed to be part of a collaborative album between Shakur and BCC titled One Nation but was never officially released due to Shakur's death. What's different about Better Dayz is that there were no censored references to Death Row Records. Unlike his album Until The End Of Time, where only three songs weren't censored of the infamous label.\n\nIt features 23 unreleased recordings including remixes from the period of 1994-1996, with appearances by Nas, Outlawz, Mýa, Jazze Pha, Ron Isley, and Tyrese, among others. The hit single, \"Thugz Mansion,\" comes in two versions: the Nas acoustic version, on which the music video is based, and a hip hop version featuring Anthony Hamilton. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/Better+Dayz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
