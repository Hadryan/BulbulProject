The album was released on June 11, 2001. The title of the album makes reference to the band's feelings regarding 'music being more important than the band making it'. Band frontman Fran stated in an interview that the album's title referred to the band's status in 'having famous songs, but not being famous themselves'. The album spent four weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart, selling more copies in that time than The Man Who managed in half a year.\n\n\nReviews:\nQ Magazine said of the album, \"While the wheel remains un-reinvented, The Invisible Band finds its mark with unerring accuracy\".[1] While Launch also said of the album, \"Songs like the stirring \"Side\", the delicate \"Dear Diary\", and the glistening \"Follow The Light\" are among the best and most fully crafted of Fran Healy's short but accomplished writing career\".[1] Leonard's Lair fully reviewed the album, claiming that, \"Along with Coldplay's 'Parachutes', 'The Man Who' slowly became one of the ubiquitous releases at the turn of the century. Yet although the likes of 'Turn' and 'Driftwood' were undeniably easy on the ear paradigms for thoughtful indie/adult rock, they seemed to lack any kind of edge to go further particularly on the unremarkable 'Why Does It Always Rain On Me?' which was in danger of becoming their musical albatross. It seems as they have never been away but the follow-up release signifies their intention to become known as an albums band. The singles thus far, 'Sing' and 'Side', both feature hypnotic tunes courtesy mainly of Andy Dunlop's fine guitar work; the former is hopeful and joyous whilst the latter is steeped in melancholy. Further exposure to the album unveils a remarkably consistent level of songwriting with the unassuming-looking Dunlop always able to turn guitar and even banjo into memorable verses and choruses whilst Fran Healy sensibly never over-reaches in his successful quest for the yearning vocal. It's easy to imagine that the earnest, yet brilliant, likes of 'The Last Train' and 'Pipe Dreams' might alienate former fans but Travis are clearly above turning into victims of their own success. As an exercise in how modern rock should sound like, 'The Invisible Band' will take some beating\".\n\nTracklisting:\n\"Sing\" – 3:48\n\"Dear Diary\" – 2:57\n\"Side\" – 3:59\n\"Pipe Dreams\" – 4:05\n\"Flowers in the Window\" – 3:41\n\"The Cage\" – 3:05\n\"Safe\" – 4:23\n\"Follow the Light\" – 3:08\n\"Last Train\" – 3:16\n\"Afterglow\" – 4:05\n\"Indefinitely\" – 3:52\n\"The Humpty Dumpty Love Song\" – 5:02\nAmerican/Japanese/Australian Bonus Tracks[3]\n\"Ring Out The Bell\"\n\"You Don't Know What I'm Like\"\n\"Beautiful\"\n\nPersonnel:\nFrancis Healy – vocals, guitar, piano\nAndy Dunlop – guitar\nDougie Payne – bass guitar\nNeil Primrose – drums <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis/The+Invisible+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
