The album was written, performed, and recorded by Kevin Barnes, with assistance from friends and family: prominent Elephant Six members Bryan Poole, Jamey Huggins and Heather McIntosh, as well as Barnes' wife Nina Twin, and daughter Alabee Blonde. Credits also feature Georgie Fruit, a glam rock alter-ego of Barnes.\n\nBarnes has described the album as a concept album, detailing his transformation from Kevin Barnes into Georgie Fruit. The transformation takes place during \"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal,\" the 12-minute long \"turning point\" of the album. In addition, the album namechecks many things commonly associated with glam rock, such as drugs, art and fashion; \"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal\" alludes to Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and specifically mentions Georges Bataille's novel Histoire de l'oeil.\n\nBarnes credits his being prescribed antidepressants with the making of the album. \"The real issue was a chemical thing, so when I finally got on medication, that balanced it out. So that helped me have a better perspective on things and helped my relationship with my wife and helped me through the album.\" \"Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse\", the album's first single, chronicles his struggle with chemical imbalance and mood disorders. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/of+Montreal/Hissing+Fauna,+Are+You+the+Destroyer%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
