A heady mix of electronic dance anthems, soul-stirring Pop songs, deep, dark Funk and quirky lyrical genius, Overpowered is a thrilling and contemporary marriage of edgy Pop and irresistible Disco. Róisín co-wrote and co-produced the entire album, bringing her own vision and focus to these songs whilst working with a variety of producers, writers and mixers to create what is without doubt her finest record; unpredictable, creative, inventive, exciting and hugely accessible. Working with the likes of Seiji, Andy Cato (Groove Armada), Jimmy Douglass, Ill Factor, and Parrot & Dean of All Seeing I / I Monster, Róisín has brought her love of the dance floor right to the very heart of the album. This is one of the albums of the year - a breathtaking modern classic. Features the singles 'Let Me Know' and 'Overpowered'.
