The song's accompanying music video was directed by David Lynch. The videos to \"Pale Horses\" and \"Mistake\" feature the alien shown on the cover and a dog. The alien is a new design of \"Little Idiot\" who appeared in earlier videos (the videos for Play's \"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\" and \"Natural Blues\" are both examples) and is also the name of Moby's own label, on which the album was released.\n\nThe album was re-released as a Deluxe Edition on 23 November 2009 featuring the complete Wait for Me original album, two new songs (including the brand new single \"One Time We Lived\"), an extra CD of ambient versions of almost all the songs, and a DVD featuring many recent live performances, an intimate EPK of the album, a section of questions and answers, and five music videos made for the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Moby/Wait+for+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
