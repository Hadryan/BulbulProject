A press-conference with Manson in April 2007 revealed that the album was a collaboration strictly between Manson and Skold. It was produced by Marilyn Manson and Skold, and mixed by Sean Beavan. It has been stated that there were originally around 20 embryonic songs, all written by Skold, two of which (that didn't make the album) Manson considered complete with lyrics and vocals. Manson stated that he had a difficult time cutting some of them, but felt he had to in order to prevent the album from being \"diluted\". This album was also the last to feature Tim Skold's contributions, having been replaced by Twiggy Ramirez the following January. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Manson/Eat+Me,+Drink+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
