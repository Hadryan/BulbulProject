Goblin continues Tyler's dialogues with his fictional therapist Dr. TC, first heard on Bastard. The tracklisting is for the explicit edition of the album. A standard clean edition, as well as a deluxe clean edition is available also.\nThe album was preceded by singles \"Sandwitches\", featuring Hodgy Beats, \"Yonkers\", \"She\", featuring Frank Ocean, and \"Bitch Suck Dick\", featuring Jasper Dolphin & Taco Bennett. The single \"Yonkers\" is considered responsible for garnering the significant internet and industry buzz surrounding the OF group at the time of the album's release. Upon release, Goblin received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album cover features Buffalo Bill at age 19. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tyler,+the+Creator/Goblin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
