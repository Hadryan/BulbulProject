It is their first album with their new record label, Roadrunner Records.\n\nIt is also the first album by Opeth to include Per Wiberg as a \"permanent\" member, although Wiberg contributed keyboard work to Opeth's live performances starting around the time of Deliverance. As well, this is the last album by the band featuring long-time guitarist Peter Lindgren and drummer Martin Lopez.\n\nGhost Reveries was recorded at Fascination Street Studios, which are located in Örebro, Sweden. The album's artwork is by Travis Smith, who has contributed artwork to Opeth's previous releases. Ghost Reveries was released in Europe on August 29, 2005 and in North America on August 30, 2005 and peaked on the Billboard 200 at #64. The album was also ranked number 54 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time.\n\nThe album's single is \"The Grand Conjuration\". A music video of the song has been released, though about half the song was edited from the video due to the length of the song.\n\nThis album also sees the return of death growling, and shred-like cadenzas, absent from their previous album Damnation.\n\nA special edition of the album was released by Roadrunner Records on October 31, 2006. It is packaged in a large digipak and contains a CD and DVD, along with new cover art and an extended booklet featuring extra album artwork and a letter from Mikael Åkerfeldt. The CD contains the original tracks from the album as well as a bonus cover of \"Soldier of Fortune\" by Deep Purple, which was recorded as a live take with the band's new drummer, Martin Axenrot. The DVD contains a Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound mix (though does not include the bonus track), and 40 minute documentary, and the video for \"The Grand Conjuration\". This documentary details the making of Ghost Reveries, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the band's day-to-day life while recording and touring.\n\nNote: Despite the track list here, \"Reverie\" is included at the end of \"Atonement\" and not at the beginning of \"Harlequin Forest\". It was included in the pregap on the CD, but digital versions do not have pregaps. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Opeth/Ghost+Reveries\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
