It was recorded in the Southern Studios, Wood Green, London and released in November 18, 1985 on Blanco y Negro Records. \n\nThe album is considered a landmark recording: its combination of guitar feedback with traditional pop song structures proved influential on the forthcoming shoegaze genre and alternative rock in general. The band would move away from its abrasive sound with the release of their second album, 1987's Darklands. The band had been signed by Blanco y Negro on the strength of their debut, Slaughter Joe-produced single \"Upside Down\" and media attention generated by the band's highly charged and energetic gigs. The album includes the singles \"Never Understand\", \"You Trip Me Up\" and \"Just Like Honey\". Following reissue on CD in August 1986, the bonus track \"Some Candy Talking\", which was originally released on the namesake EP, was included on the album, only on the UK Blanco y Negro CDs released in 1986 and 1997; in the USA, it was released on CD by Reprise in 1986 and American Recordings in 1993 without the bonus track. In 2006, the album was remastered and released in DualDisc format without \"Some Candy Talking\" to conform with the original playlist. In 2011, it was re-released (along with the other five studio albums) by Edsel in collaboration with Rhino as a two-CD set with extra tracks (singles, B-sides, demos and Peel Sessions) and a DVD (NTSC, all-region).\n\nPersonnel\nJim Reid – vocals, guitar\nWilliam Reid – vocals, guitar\nDouglas Hart – bass\nBobby Gillespie – drums\n\nAdditional musicians\nKaren Parker – backing vocals\nLaurence Verfaillie – backing vocals\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jesus+and+Mary+Chain/Psychocandy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
