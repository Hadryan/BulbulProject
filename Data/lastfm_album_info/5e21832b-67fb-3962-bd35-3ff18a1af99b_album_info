It is Staind's most successful album to date, and was the album that broke them into the mainstream. It was a huge international success for the band, as it spent 3 weeks at number 1 position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top 10 album charts of The Billboard 200, the UK and New Zealand. It sold 4 million copies in 2001. The album was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA.\n\nA total of 5 singles were released from this album, \"It's Been Awhile\", \"Fade\", \"Outside\", \"For You\" and \"Epiphany\", all of which did reasonably well. There were videos made for each of these songs (some of which can be found on Staind's MTV Unplugged DVD). The first four singles had varying degrees of success in the UK, \"It's Been Awhile\" charting the highest of the four released in both countries. The album also includes a track called \"Waste\" dedicated to two teenage fans who committed suicide. Like the band's previous effort \"Dysfunction\", Break The Cycle is a heavy and aggressive alternative metal album. However, the album shows the band showing more on its post-grunge sound, which would play a bigger part on the band's future albums. This is evident in the album's hit \"It's Been Awhile\" and other songs on the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Staind/Break+the+Cycle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
