It stayed in the Top 50 of the Billboard 200 chart for over fifty weeks. Singles from the album include, in order released, \"Somebody Told Me\", \"Mr. Brightside\", \"All These Things That I've Done\", and \"Smile Like You Mean It\". \n\nTowards the end of 2005, The Killers also released the album on 7\" vinyl in a boxset of 11 discs. On side A of each of the discs is the album track, and on the B-side are non-album tracks. It is also one of the last five albums, in order of chronology, to be placed in the \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". Hot Fuss sold more than 2,500,000 copies in the first year of its release. After being nominated for five Grammys, it has since sold more than 5,000,000 copies worldwide.\n\nMurder Trilogy:\n\n2 of the songs on the album (\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\" and \"Midnight Show\") are a continuing story along with \"Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf\" from Sawdust, which is known as the Murder Trilogy. The band have also said they may expand this in the future. The order of the songs is the reverse of how they appeared on the albums, with \"Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf\" being first, followed by \"Midnight Show\" and finally \"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\". In their official biography the Killers explain a few of the theories behind the Murder Trilogy. For example Brandon Flowers says \"There was water involved, although he didnâ€™t drown her.\"\n\nHot Fuss was released on June 7, 2004 in the United Kingdom and on June 15, 2004 in the United States. The album reached top of the album charts in both the United Kingdom and Australia and was certified 3x Platinum in Canada (300,000 units) by the CRIA in October 2005. It stayed in the Top 50 of the Billboard 200 chart for over fifty weeks. Singles from the album include, in order released, \"Somebody Told Me\", \"Mr. Brightside\", \"All These Things That I've Done\" and \"Smile Like You Mean It\". Towards the end of 2005, The Killers also released the album on 7\" vinyl in a box set of 11 discs. On side A of each disc is the album track and on the B-side are non-album tracks. It is also one of the five most recent albums listed as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Hot Fuss sold more than 2,500,000 copies in the first year of its release.\n\nInitial critical response to Hot Fuss was generally positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 66, based on 20 reviews. Rolling Stone gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five. Reviewer Jenny Eliscu compared the band's music to contemporaries The Rapture and Franz Ferdinand, stating that in comparison to those groups The Killers \"have actual pop songs -- in spades\". Eliscu concluded, \"This album is all Killers, no filler.\" In a mixed review, Entertainment Weekly wildly praised the song \"Somebody Told Me\" while asking \"As for the rest, isn't it a little too early for a Strokes tribute band?\", and ultimately gave the album a \"C\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/Hot+Fuss\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
