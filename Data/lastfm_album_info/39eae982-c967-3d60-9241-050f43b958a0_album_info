The album is a departure from the synthpop style that first brought the band acclaim on their major label debut, Oracular Spectacular, and features a more progressive, guitar-driven sound. MGMT began writing the tracks that would ultimately appear on Congratulations in early 2009 in a \"Heaven\". They eventually headed to a Malibu studio to work on the album with producer Pete Kember, ex-member of Spacemen 3, where vocal contributions from Royal Trux singer Jennifer Herrema were also recorded for the album. VanWyngarden has stated that the album is influenced by the band's massive rise in popularity since Oracular Spectacular's release. \"It's us trying to deal with all the craziness that's been going on since our last album took off. Sometimes it just doesn't feel natural\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/MGMT/Congratulations\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
