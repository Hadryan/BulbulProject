Although not all of Björk's singles are included on this collection, all of the songs on Greatest Hits were released as singles. The tracks were selected by fans through a survey on Björk's website. Greatest Hits presents the songs in descending order of most-popular votes, with the exception of \"It's In Our Hands\" which was a new song and appears at the end of the compilation.\nAs with many greatest hits compilation albums, some of Björk's biggest singles were absent. The most obvious omission is \"It's Oh So Quiet\", her highest-charting UK hit. Also missing are \"Alarm Call\", \"I Miss You\", \"Cocoon\" and \"Violently Happy\" as well as any pre-Debut material.\nThe tracks \"Human Behaviour\", \"Big Time Sensuality\", and \"Venus as a Boy\" are taken from Björk's 1993 album Debut. \"Play Dead\" was originally released on the Young Americans movie soundtrack (1993) but was included on some editions of Debut.\n\n\"Hyperballad\", \"Army of Me\", \"Isobel\", and \"Possibly Maybe\" are from the 1995 Post album.\n\n\"All Is Full of Love\", \"Jóga\", \"Bachelorette\", and \"Hunter\" are from her 1997 Homogenic album.\n\nFinally, \"Pagan Poetry\" and \"Hidden Place\" are found on her 2001 Vespertine album.\n\nThe artwork on the CD was produced in collaboration with Icelandic contemporary artist Gabríela Fridriksdóttir. It is the only one of Björk's album covers that includes both a logo and a title. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
