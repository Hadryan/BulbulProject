Filled, from beginning to end, with crunching guitars, bumping rhythm, and sweet vocals, 'Us Against The Crown' showcases the band's array of musical talents and influences from reggae all the way to hard rock. Evidence of the love for artists from Bob Marley to Rage Against The Machine can be found throughout the disc. The album is also politically charged with classic 'fight songs' showcasing the beliefs of the songwriter on a wide variety of affairs, including the war in Iraq. 'Camilo' is a song about a soldier who decided to not go back to war after being home on leave (which is based on true story). Some classic State Radio tracks show up on the album, with a new flavor and a fuller sound ('Gunship Politico', 'The Diner Song', and 'Calvado's Chopper'). Horns and reggae flair fill the speakers with bumping beats and funky guitar rhythms on 'Right Me Up' and 'Man In The Hall'. 'Riddle In Londontown' is a standout track, showcasing the songwriter's ability to adapt a song formerly played with his old band and make it new and different with his new one (the song, know just as 'Riddle', was played with Dispatch during the shows surrounding their final performance -- it appears on Dispatch's live album 'All Points Bulletin'). It seems as though Chad has settled into an excellent new place with his new band, pulling from his unique style that was just one third of an awesome band, and bringing it out in full force. You can rest assured that State Radio, on the heels of 'Us Against The Crown', is sure to have the same success as Dispatch, while starting down the road to a second incredible independent career.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/State+Radio/Us+Against+The+Crown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
