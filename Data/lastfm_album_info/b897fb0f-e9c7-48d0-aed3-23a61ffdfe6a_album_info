by British band Anathema. It was released on June 21 1999 through Music For Nations. The album marked a definitive departure from Anathema's death/doom roots, focusing on more alternative and atmospheric 70's style progressive/blues rock instead. The album, however, still represents Anathema's metallic edge. It was the first album without Duncan Patterson, who had a leading role as songwriter on the band's past two albums. From here on Danny Cavanagh would take over this duty. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Anathema/Judgement\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Judgement is an album by British band Anathema.
