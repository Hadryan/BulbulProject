It was recorded at midnight in two separate two-hour sessions, over two days in October 1971, featuring only Nick Drake's vocals and guitar, as well as some piano later overdubbed by Drake on the title track.\n\nInitially, Pink Moon garnered a small amount of critical attention, but decades after Drake's death it received widespread public and critical acclaim. The music on Pink Moon is sparse and unadorned (especially in comparison to Drake's previous recordings), leading some to consider it to be the least accessible of his three albums, though it nevertheless continues to be thought of by many of his fans as his greatest work.\n\nThe cover of the album features an illustration by the partner of Drake's sister Gabrielle, Michael Trevithick. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Drake/Pink+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
