It was released on November 6, 2013 by Streamline and Interscope Records. She began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second studio album, Born This Way. Work continued into 2012 and 2013, during which time Gaga was travelling for her headlining Born This Way Ball and recovering from surgery for an injury that she sustained while touring.\n\nGaga described ARTPOP as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse Warholian\" phenomenon in pop culture. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way. Assuming an integral position in its production, she enlisted longtime collaborators including Paul \"DJ White Shadow\" Blair and RedOne and newer partners Zedd and Madeon to achieve Gaga's desired sound. The lyrical themes revolve around her personal views of fame, love, sex, feminism, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny; references include Greek and Roman mythology, and classic jazz and electronic musician Sun Ra. ARTPOP also features guest vocals from several new partners: T.I., Too Short, Twista, and R. Kelly. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/ARTPOP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
