The inclusion of the 1967 singles on CD with this album meant both that the Magical Mystery Tour CD would be of comparable length to the band's other album CDs, and that those three singles would not need to be included on Past Masters, a two-volume compilation designed to accompany the initial CD album releases and provide all non-album tracks (mostly singles) on CD format. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Magical+Mystery+Tour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
