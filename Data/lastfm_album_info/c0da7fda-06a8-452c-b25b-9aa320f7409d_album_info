It was released as a double album in March 1987 by their American record company, Sire Records. Its highest chart position was number 63. Popular demand prompted their British record company, Rough Trade, to issue the album domestically as well. Upon its release in the UK in May 1987, it reached number 38 on the British charts. In 2003, the album was ranked number 365 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1990.\n\nThe album was released as the American counterpart to their recent British compilation The World Won't Listen and consisted of all singles and nearly all b-sides that had not at that point been available in the States, either on single or album, with a few other tracks added. The title is borrowed from a line in Elizabeth Smart's extended prose poem \"By Grand Central Station I Sat Down And Wept.\"\nThe album was intended to substitute for both The World Won't Listen and their 1984 compilation Hatful of Hollow as these had not been released in the United States. This is why the non-single track \"This Night Has Opened My Eyes\" from Hatful of Hollow was included. (Single a-sides \"This Charming Man\" and \"How Soon Is Now?\" had already been released in the U.S. as bonus cuts on the LPs The Smiths and Meat Is Murder, respectively.)\nAs with The World Won't Listen, this compilation includes the scrapped single \"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\" (passed over in favour of \"Shoplifters of the World Unite\"), albeit in a different mix.\nBecause the album offered many B-sides (and the \"Sheila Take a Bow\" single) that had never been collected onto an album before, Louder Than Bombs became very popular on import with fans in the UK. To avoid high import prices being paid, The Smiths' domestic record company, Rough Trade, decided to release the compilation as well, provoking cries of outrage by fans who only two months previously had shelled out for the slimmer UK counterpart. The blow was somewhat softened by the fact that the double album retailed at single album price.\nAfter WEA acquired the Smiths back catalogue in 1992, all Smiths albums were re-released at mid price, including Louder Than Bombs.\n\nThe sleeve for Louder Than Bombs, designed by Morrissey, features British playwright Shelagh Delaney of Salford, Greater Manchester. The photograph was originally published in the Saturday Evening Post after Delaney, at the age of 19, had made a striking literary debut with her play A Taste of Honey. The play inspired many early lyrics written by Morrissey, and the song \"This Night Has Opened My Eyes\" (included here) is based on the plight of the play's heroine, Jo, an unwed mother.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/Louder+Than+Bombs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
