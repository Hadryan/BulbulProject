Some of the songs were written by a different line-up than the musicians that played the songs in the studio. It was recorded at Music America Studios, Rochester, New York. It was released by Megaforce on July 29, 1983 and later re-released by Elektra records.\n\nBefore Kill 'Em All was recorded, the songs were written and recorded as demos by James Hetfield, Lloyd Grant, Ron McGovney and Lars Ulrich. On later demos, featuring the first full tracks that would appear on Kill 'Em All, Dave Mustaine took Lloyd's place and Ron was replaced by Cliff Burton. Mustaine was kicked from the band for having a bad attitude and was replaced by the final Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett. With this final line-up Kill 'Em All was recorded.\n\nThe album features a lot of Metallica's remarkable thrash songs such as: Seek & Destroy, Whiplash and The Four Horsemen. Unlike the later albums, Kill 'Em All didn't have any symphonic sounds or instruments supporting the tracks.\n\nThe original title of the album was supposed to be Metal Up Your Ass and it had a different cover artwork (hand with a dagger sticking out from WC). Megaforce permissed it. The title Kill 'Em All was what Cliff Burton said after the record company rejected the original Metal Up Your Ass cover. \"Just fuckin' kill 'em all\" were his exact words. \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Kill+%27Em+All\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
