Due to an early leak of the album over the Internet in early March 2008, the duo decided to push up the release from April 8. The album was released to the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3 on March 18. In late January, an assumed leaked track appeared on several music blogs. \"Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)\", the previously unknown song, was given positive reviews from most music outlets. \"Run\" was released as the album's first single as a digital download in the U.S. on February 5, 2008. Despite \"Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)\" being the lead single at the time, \"Going On\" was the highest charting album track on iTunes having made it as high as #23 on the Top 100 chart as of March 25, subsequently debuting at #88 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was then released as the second single from the album, and the song's video premiered on March 20, 2008. The album's third single, \"Who's Gonna Save My Soul\" was premiered by hip hop band The Roots' drummer Questlove through a video uploaded to YouTube.[13] An early leak of the album over the Internet in early March, 2008, prompted the duo to push the release of the album from April 8. Digital versions of the sophomore effort were released to the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3 on March 18.[14] Physical copies of the album were slated for March 25, however some copies hit independent record stores on March 18. An instrumental reverse edition of the album, retitled elpuoc ddo eht, was released on April 17, 2008. The entire album is fused into one 38:44 second track played completely in reverse, starting with the album's last song and ending with the album's first. This unorthodox edition was released officially by Danger Mouse and is legally available as a second disc on the vinyl edition of the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gnarls+Barkley/The+Odd+Couple\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
