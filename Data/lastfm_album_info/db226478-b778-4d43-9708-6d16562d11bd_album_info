It was released under the band's own record label, Abstract Dragon, through Vagrant Records.\nUnlike Beat The Devil's Tattoo, the album wasn't produced by Michael Been, who died after he suffered a heart attack mid-tour in 2010 while the band was playing at Pukkelpop. As a result, Specter at the Feast was a way for the band to mourn their loss and rid the pain, as he was the father of bassist Robert Levon Been, but also their live sound technician and a mentor to all the members.[9]\n\nThe band have made the first single from the record, a cover of The Call's 1989 hit \"Let the Day Begin\", available as a free download on their official website. The same day, the song became Q Magazine's track of the day.[10] The band have also released the \"Let the Day Begin\" EP for free, consisting of the single and the album track \"Returning\", which has also been made available for streaming on the official website.[11]\n\nThe band have released a six-part promotional short film documenting the recording of Specter at the Feast.[9]\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n\"Fire Walker\" – 6:23\n\"Let the Day Begin\" – 4:06\n\"Returning\" – 5:34\n\"Lullaby\" – 4:36\n\"Hate the Taste\" – 3:50\n\"Rival\" – 3:37\n\"Teenage Disease\" – 3:22\n\"Some Kind of Ghost\" – 3:51\n\"Sometimes the Light\" – 3:20\n\"Funny Games\" – 4:38\n\"Sell It\" – 6:46\n\"Lose Yourself\" – 8:39\n\"Warning Sign\" – 5:55 (iTunes bonus)\n\"The Knife\" – 3:51 (iTunes bonus)\n\"Angel Baby\" – 4:26 (iTunes bonus) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Rebel+Motorcycle+Club/Specter+At+The+Feast\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
