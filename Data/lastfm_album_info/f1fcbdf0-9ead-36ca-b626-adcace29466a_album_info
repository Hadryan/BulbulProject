The album was released in most countries on 13 March 2006, although it was released three days earlier in Australia (standard and special editions) and New Zealand (standard edition only). Illegal copies had previously been available on the Internet since 17 January 2006, prior to the official announcement of the release. Because I Want You, released on 6 March 2006, is the first UK single from the album. The first single outside of the UK is Song to Say Goodbye, released on the same date. The second single from Meds was Infra-Red, released on 19 June 2006 in the UK. The third and final single was Meds, which received significant exposure in the U.S.; it was within the 50 most-played alternative rock songs as of mid-May 2006.\n\nPlacebo had planned to record a more electronic-, keyboard-driven sound on Meds; however, producer Dimitri Tikovoi convinced a back-to-basics approach, which Brian Molko recounted in Zero Magazine:\n\n    \"It was our producer's agenda really, which we didn't really know about until we got into the studio. ...We were in a place that was very much about samplers and computers and vintage synthesisers. This recording session really became about playing again. We were in an old-school studio so there were no real tricks to hide behind.\"\n\nOn the theme of the record, Molko says:\n\n    \"I think there's a lot of songs...about the dangers and effects of drinking. ...'Infra-red's about that, when you get very drunk and you've got a bee in your bonnet about something, and this vengeful quality emerges. You start thinking about people who've done you wrong and want to set the record straight.\"\n\nThe album was re-released by Virgin Records in the U.S. in January 2007, including an extra three tracks (Lazarus, UNEEDMEMORETHANINEEDU, and Running Up That Hill), but omitting In the Cold Light of Morning.\n\nThis album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Placebo/Meds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
