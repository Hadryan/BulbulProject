The album contains not only songs but also spoken parts narrating parts of the story.\n\nThe music is more \"melodic\" on this album, compared to previous works such as Somewhere Far Beyond, and the songs have much more fluency, without losing any of the traditional speed or guitar solos and leads. It is also the first album with Oliver Holzwarth, as guest musician.\n\nNightfall in Middle-Earth was the first album by Blind Guardian to be released in the U.S. The sales encouraged Century Media to release their entire back catalog in the U.S. In 2007, it was remastered and re-released, with one bonus track.\n\nTrack listing\nAll music written by Olbrich/Kürsch except track 6 written by Olbrich, Kürsch, Stauch, Siepen and track 16 written by Olbrich, Kürsch, Schüren.
