Taking time off from his day job as the fourth Beastie Boy, keyman Money Mark has been hanging down in the basement, surrounded by his well-worn and strictly analog Moog, Fender Rhodes, D6 Clavinet, and Hammond organ--and even an old yardsale guitar--setting new standards for the art of noodling. Keyboard Repair is a lo-fi feast of hot licks that conjures Herbie Hancock, Bernie Worrell, Billy Preston, Augustus Pablo, and Gil Scott Heron in an ultraloose swirl that includes nods to '60s breeze pop and acid rock, 70s porn funk and R&B, Santana's Latin groove, art rock, ska, Beasties' hip-hop, and enough action-packed instrumentals to rewrite the theme songs of every cheesy detective show that ever aired. --Roni Sarig   <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Money+Mark/Mark%27s+Keyboard+Repair\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
