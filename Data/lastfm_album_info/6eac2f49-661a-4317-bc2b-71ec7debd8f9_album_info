It is considered one of the first gothic rock records.\n\nFollowing a 30-date tour, Bauhaus set out to Southern Studios in London to record their first album. As the band had a clear conception of what they wanted the record to sound like, they opted to produce it themselves. While most of the album was completed with the planned release date of September 1980, the group found it difficult to record a version of \"Double Dare\" as good as the one they performed on disc jockey John Peel's BBC Radio 1 programme. Bauhaus applied to the BBC to use the Peel sessions version, but due to obstructions from the Musicians Union the process took over a month.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nPeter Murphy – vocals, guitar, production, sleeve design\nDaniel Ash – guitar, saxophone, production, sleeve design\nDavid J – bass guitar, production, sleeve design\nKevin Haskins – drums, production, sleeve design\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bauhaus/In+the+Flat+Field\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
