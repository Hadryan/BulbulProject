It was released in 1995 through Roswell and Capitol Records. It was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1996 Grammy ceremony, but it lost to Dave Grohl's former band Nirvana's album MTV Unplugged In New York. Dave Grohl has often called the Foo Fighters' debut piece to be more of a demo than an album.\n\nNearly all of the album's instrumental parts are performed by Dave Grohl. (The lone exception is a guitar part on \"X-Static\" provided by Afghan Whigs member Greg Dulli, with whom Grohl had performed as part of an all-star band on the 1994 Backbeat soundtrack.)\n\nThe Foo Fighters band, originally consisting of bassist Nate Mendel, guitarist Pat Smear, and drummer William Goldsmith, was formed by Grohl after the completion of the album in order to promote it on tour. Despite not appearing on the album itself, the band is featured in the liner notes and was paid royalties for the album.\n\nGrohl had been recording his own music for years prior, releasing a cassette called Pocketwatch (under the moniker \"Late!\") during his time in Nirvana. The album was recorded in October 1994 in Robert Lang's Studio in Seattle with friend/producer Barrett Jones. This was the same studio where Nirvana recorded its last session just nine months prior.\n\nThe gun featured on the cover is the \"XZ-38 Disintegrator Pistol,\" which was originally released in 1935 as a tie-in toy for the Buck Rogers comic strip and radio show. The guns were originally manufactured by Daisy, best known for their line of youth BB guns, and today remain sought-after collector's items.\n\nThe cover was shot by Grohl's then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, and, like the name of his band, reflects his interest in science fiction.\n\nFoo Fighters reached #3 in the UK and #23 in the US, being certified Platinum on January 26th 1996.\n\nOn Foo Fighters' 2005-2006 live set with Weezer, the band brought \"Big Me\" back into their live setlist after Weezer covered the song at several shows, as Weezer have been longtime fans of the Foo Fighters. In 1995 Dave Grohl sent Weezer leader Rivers Cuomo a copy of the Foo Fighters debut with a note saying he really liked The Blue Album.\n\nThe album won the band their first and only MTV VMA for \"Big Me.\"\n\nKerrang! magazine \"100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\" - Editors Choice #19 (1998)\nKerrang! magazine \"100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\" - Readers Choice #34 (1998)\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, edited by Robert Dimery (2006)\nRolling Stone ranked the album #2 in the Albums of the Year Critic Picks of 1995.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Foo+Fighters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
