The album was promoted by three singles: \"Burn My Shadow\", \"Hold My Hand\" and \"Restless\". The video for \"Burn my Shadow\" featured the actor Goran Višnjić.\n\nThe cover art was designed by 3D of Massive Attack.\n\nThe track \"Chemistry\" is used as the instrumental track for \"Hello/Goodbye (Uncool)\" by Lupe Fiasco from his 2007 album Lupe Fiasco's The Cool. Lupe Fiasco chose War Stories as his #1 album of the year as posted to a video on Myspace.\n\nThe song \"Burn My Shadow\" was used during the climax of the movie Repo Men. It was also featured in an Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood trailer and the trailer for the 2009 video game Fuel.\n\nReviews of the album were generally favorable. Notably, the tracks \"Burn My Shadow\" and \"When Things Explode\" (which are thematically similar and feature the vocals of Ian Astbury) received nearly universal praise, even from negative or mediocre reviews such as those written by Pitchfork Media and NME. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/UNKLE/War+Stories\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
