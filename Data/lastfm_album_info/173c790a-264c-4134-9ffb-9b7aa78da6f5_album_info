Bassist Georg Hólm described the album as having \"more electronic stuff than before\" but not being \"a dance album\". The first single \"Ekki Múkk\", as well as an accompanying video, was released on the same day. Hólm also said of the album - \"I really can’t remember why we started this record, I no longer know what we were trying to do back then. I do know session after session went pear-shaped, we lost focus and almost gave up... did give up for a while. But then something happened and form started to emerge, and now I can honestly say that it’s the only Sigur Rós record I have listened to for pleasure in my own house after we’ve finished it.\" The song \"Varðeldur\" is a different version of the song \"Lúppulagið\" from the live album Inni. Valtari's album cover is by Jónsi's sisters, Lilja and Inga Birgisdóttir. Inga was also the baby on the cover art for Sigur Rós' debut album Von. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sigur+R%C3%B3s/Valtari\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
