In an interview done for daily Internet publication Pitchfork, Björk talked for the first time about the theme of the album.\n\n\"But with this one, it was different because I knew more emotionally what I wanted. And because I'd done two or three projects in a row that were quite serious, maybe I just needed to get that out of my system or something. So all I wanted to do for this album was just to have fun and do something that was full-bodied and really up.\"\n\nThe full album was accidentally made available on the UK iTunes Store at midnight on April 23, 2007 for a total of six hours, two weeks before the album's official release date. This led to the album being leaked online the following day.\n\nFor this album, Björk used brass instruments for almost all the songs. These were sometimes sampled.\n\nThe album attracted attention due to the inclusion of three tracks co-produced by R&B record producer Timbaland.\n\nThe track titles were confirmed in an article on MTV, March 14, 2007, and confirmed in a post on sprk.nl, 20 March 2007. One other track, \"Trance\", is rumored to appear as a future b-side. The track entitled \"Vertebrae by Vertebrae\" was retitled from the previous, \"Energy\". \"Vertebrae by Vertebrae\" uses a sample from Björk's previous project, \"The Music from Drawing Restraint 9\".\n\nVolta was released in three editions in the UK: a digipak CD edition; a limited edition CD/DVD edition (featuring surround audio in DTS); and a double vinyl edition. The UK and Japanese editions of the album feature the Mark Bell Mix of \"I See Who You Are\" as a bonus track. Later editions were released in regular jewelcases.\n\nVolta spent nine weeks at number one on Billboard's Top Electronic Albums chart and in the first three months of release sold over half a million copies worldwide. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/Volta\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
