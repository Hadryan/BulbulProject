The album was also released on double vinyl 12\" on Bong Load Custom Records, and later rereleased by Plain Records in 2008. It is also available as a digital download.\n\nThe title is thought to be taken from a song by Schoolhouse Rock!. Smith covered this song, but it did not make the final track listing.\n\nCompared to Smith's earlier work, Figure 8 is more instrumentally ornate, and the lyrics are more impressionistic. Smith described the songs on the album as \"more...fragmented and dreamlike\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith/Figure+8\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
