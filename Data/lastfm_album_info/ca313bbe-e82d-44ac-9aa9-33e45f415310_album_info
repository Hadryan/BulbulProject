In 2003, it was ranked #2 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. According to Acclaimedmusic.net, Pet Sounds is the second most acclaimed album of all time by music journalists, after 'Revolver' by The Beatles released in the same year.\n\nPet Sounds was created several months after Brian Wilson had quit touring with the band in order to focus his attention on writing and recording. In it, he wove elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, coupled with sound effects and unconventional instruments such as bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, the Electro-Theremin, and dog whistles, along with the more usual keyboards and guitars. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
