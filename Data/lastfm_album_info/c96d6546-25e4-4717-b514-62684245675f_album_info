It is notable for injecting Dylan's brand of blues rock, fully established on Highway 61 Revisited, with a more eclectic sound and even more surreal lyrics. Despite its uncompromising nature, it has come to be regarded as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, and \"one of the greatest rock & roll albums ever made\".\n\nIt also marked the end of an era for Dylan, who would soon be involved in a motorcycle accident (significantly changing his musical approach).\n\nRecorded in Nashville, the album was produced by Bob Johnston. It peaked at #9 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart in the US, eventually going double-platinum, while it reached #3 in the UK. It is ranked as the ninth greatest album of all time by both VH1 and Rolling Stone. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Blonde+on+Blonde\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
