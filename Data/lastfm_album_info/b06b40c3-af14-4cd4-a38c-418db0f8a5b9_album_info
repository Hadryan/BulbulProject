A commercial success, Contraband debuted at number one on the American Billboard 200 chart and was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA.\n\nVelvet Revolver formed when three Guns N' Roses musicians - Slash (guitar), Duff McKagan (bass) and Matt Sorum (drums) - combined to play at a benefit concert for fellow musician Randy Castillo in 2002. They decided to form another band and recruited guitarist Dave Kushner who had previously played with Suicidal Tendencies, Wasted Youth, and Dave Navarro. Kushner had gone to school with Slash and had worked with McKagan before. The quartet was known as The Project pending the selection of a permanent name.\n\nThe quartet then set about recruiting a lead singer with the recruitment process filmed by VH1. Several lead singers auditioned including Josh Todd of Buckcherry, Kelly Shaefer of Neurotica and Travis Meeks of Days of the New but they were unsuccessful. Scott Weiland had become friends with McKagan and had played on the same bill as Kushner when Stone Temple Pilots were known as Mighty Joe Young and Kushner was in the Electric Love Hogs. Weiland heard the material and offered his services as the lead singer and the band clicked. Slash suggested the name Revolver for the project and Weiland suggested the addition of Velvet to the title.\n\nVelvet Revolver recorded its first track \"Set Me Free\" for The Hulk soundtrack in 2003, along with a cover of Pink Floyd's \"Money\" for The Italian Job. The band played their first live gig at the El Rey in Los Angeles in July 2003. It recorded Contraband in the latter part of 2003 with recording complicated by Weiland's court appearances for drug charges and his subsequent sentencing to undertake rehabilitation.\n\nIn February 2005, RCA Records released a \"Tour Edition\" of the album in Europe, which included a bonus disc containing three songs: \"Surrender\" (originally by Cheap Trick), \"No More, No More\" (originally by Aerosmith), and an acoustic version of \"Fall to Pieces\".\n\nThe United States release of the disc uses the MediaMax CD-3 system for copy protection, while Macrovision CDS-200 is used for the European release.\n\nContraband debuted at #1 on the Billboard album chart, selling over 250,000 copies. Notably, this marked the best-ever debut for a new rock artist in the SoundScan era. The album would later sell over 2.9 million copies in the United States, and 4 million worldwide, It was Scott Weiland's first album to top the charts in ten years since STP's Purple. It was also his first album to go multi-platinum since STP's Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop.\n\nThe first single, \"Slither\", topped a composite world modern rock chart in June, and later hit #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart for 8 weeks. The follow-up, \"Fall to Pieces\", was a major crossover hit that reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart for 11 weeks.\n\nIn 2005, Velvet Revolver won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance, an award Weiland had previously won for the Stone Temple Pilots song \"Plush\" in 1994. At the ceremony, they were asked to play the music for a cover of The Beatles' \"Across the Universe\". The live recording was a hit on iTunes, with all proceeds going to charity. Months later, VR was also asked to play the music for a cover of Eric Clapton's \"Tears in Heaven\". The single was to aid victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, with all proceeds going to Save the Children Foundation.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Velvet+Revolver/Contraband\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
