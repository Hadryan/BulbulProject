It was the first release the band had done with Spitfire Records. Co-produced by band members, Chuck Billy, and Eric Peterson, this was the first album featuring new musicians Steve DiGiorgio on bass guitar and Dave Lombardo on drums. Billy, Peterson, and Lombardo, along with longtime Testament collaborator Del James, are also given composer credits on the album.\n\nRelease:\nThe Gathering featured eleven tracks when it was released, drawing critic and fan acclaim for such songs as \"D.N.R. (Do Not Resuscitate)\", \"Riding the Snake\", and \"Legions of the Dead\". After release Testament embarked on the Riding the Snake World Tour to promote the album with \"touring\" lead guitarist Steve Smyth (ex-Vicious Rumors) and ex-Sadus drummer Jon Allen. The tour ended in 2001 shortly before frontman Chuck Billy was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nThe Gathering is the first of five albums to date featuring engineering and mixing work done with artist Andy Sneap. It is also the first of five reissues that Testament has done with Prosthetic Records. The album was reissued January 8, 2008, with an instrumental bonus track, \"Hammer of the Gods,\" increasing the new track total to twelve. While \"Hammer of the Gods\" is listed on the track listing of the original American release, it does not actually appear on the CD. However, it does appear on the worldwide Prosthetic Records 2008 reissue.\n\nAlbum cover artwork for The Gathering was done by Dave McKean who also did the cover art for the two prior Testament studio albums Demonic and Low. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Testament/The+Gathering\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
