It was released in September 1998 on Epic Records, and in the United States the following year, on Virgin Records.\n\nThe title is a quotation taken from a speech given by Welsh British Labour Party politician Aneurin Bevan. Its working title was simply 'Manic Street Preachers'.\n\nThis Is My Truth Tell Me Yours was the first Manics album to feature lyrics solely by Nicky Wire, while all the music was written by the habitual duo of James Dean Bradfield and cousin Sean Moore. The album is a much more subdued affair compared to previous albums with many songs having a more acoustic feel.\n\nAt the same time it shows the band experimenting with studio and production possibilities, as shown in several tracks â€” \"S.Y.M.M.\", \"I'm Not Working\" and \"Born a Girl\". In the bridge of the track \"Ready for Drowning\" there is a sample of Richard Burton (as John Morlar from the 1978 film The Medusa Touch): \"I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads\".\n\nThe cover photograph was taken on Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog. Hidden behind the disc's tray is a quotation from the 1995 book, No Truce With The Furies by R. S. Thomas.\n\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1999 Brit Awards.\n\nThe album debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart and spent three weeks at the top of the charts.\n\nThe album was preceded by the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\", which debuted at #1 on the UK Singles Chart, their first single to do so. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/This+Is+My+Truth+Tell+Me+Yours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
