They released just one album, entitled Around The Next Dream, which was released on the Virgin record label. It reached Number 9 in the UK Albums Chart in the summer of 1994, but spent only four weeks in the listings. The track, Where In The World was issued as a single, reaching Number 57 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1994. Much of the work was written by Moore with contributions by Bruce and Baker.\n\nThe band went on a short UK tour to coincide with the album's release and also played a handful of rock festivals on the continent, before disbanding.\n\n\nAllmusic information\n\nAny time Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce work together, comparisons to Cream are inevitable. Given that this album's opener, Waiting in the Wings, bears a passing resemblance to White Room, and that this is then followed by a Crossroads knockoff, perhaps the comparisons are justifiable. Unfortunately, BBM doesn't benefit from such self-plagiarism. The weak link is, surprisingly, not with the Clapton stand-in, Gary Moore -- it's in the underwhelming drumming and bass playing by the two bona fide Creamsters. Bruce's voice is as pleasing as ever, but his and Baker's merely competent English blues instrumental work will fall short of the expectations of fans who know what they're capable of.\n\n\nCredits\n\nBBM\n\n    * Ginger Baker – drums, percussion, keyboards, vocals\n    * Jack Bruce – bass guitar, cello, vocals\n    * Gary Moore – guitars, keyboards, vocals\n\nAdditional\n\n    * Ian Taylor – producer, engineer together with BBM\n    * Tommy Eyre – keyboards\n    * Arran Ahmun – drums on \"Where In The World\"\n    * Morris Murphy – trumpet on \"Glory Days\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/BBM/Around+The+Next+Dream\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
