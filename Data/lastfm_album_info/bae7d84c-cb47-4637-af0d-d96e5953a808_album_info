It is a concept album, \"a vision of a drug trip from inception to its blasted conclusion, highs and lows fully intact\".The music becomes progressively more orchestral and serene until the high of the trip, represented by \"Ecstasy Symphony\"/\"Transparent Radiation (Flashback)\", moving on to the moment of realization where the high has faded and the comedown ensues, represented by the harsh opening guitar chords in \"Things'll Never Be the Same\". Coming down is represented in the blues based \"Come Down Easy\", whilst the potentially fatal effects of an overdose are portrayed in the final track \"Call the Doctor\". The music was written by the band except \"Transparent Radiation\" which is a Red Krayola cover from their 1967 album Parable of Arable Land. The band also borrow heavily from the gospel standard covered by Bob Dylan 'In My Time of Dying\" for \"Come Down Easy\" and pay homage to Lou Reed in \"Ode to Street Hassle\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Spacemen+3/The+Perfect+Prescription\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
