First editions of the vinyl album were accompanied by an EP, the tracks from which are included on the Harvest CD, issued in 1994, along with an additional bonus track. The new remastered release, released by Pinkflag as digipacks in 2006, does not contain any extra tracks, because, according to the band, such additions dishonour the \"conceptual clarity of the original statements.\"[9] The album is so named because the band had played 154 gigs in their career at the time of the album's release. Pitchfork Media listed 154 as 85th best album of the 1970s.[10] <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wire/154\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
