The album showcased a more experimental and spontaneous side of the group, returning them to the clatter and unpredictability of their early recordings after the classic rock vibe of 1994's Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. The cover art was painted by New York-based artist Steve Keene and resembles the cover of Guru Guru's 1972 album, \"Känguru.\"\n\nRolling Stone speculated that the relative success of their previous album (having sold 169,000 copies by this time[citation needed]) was a reason for this album's eclectic nature; the magazine's review claimed Pavement were afraid of success. Stephen Malkmus later refuted this, attributing the stylistic shift to excessive marijuana consumption. Rolling Stone voted Wowee Zowee the 12th Coolest Album of all time.\n\nThe songs \"Grounded,\" \"Flux=Rad,\" \"Pueblo,\" and \"Kennel District\" were originally written at the same time as the songs that became Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain, and rough versions appear on Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins disc 2.\n\nThe album was recorded at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, with the exception of some tracks recorded at Random Falls, in NY. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pavement/Wowee+Zowee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
