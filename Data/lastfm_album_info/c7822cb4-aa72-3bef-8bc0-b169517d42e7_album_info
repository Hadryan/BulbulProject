It was released by Fiction Records on March 17, 2008 in the United Kingdom, and was released by Geffen Records on April 22, 2008 in the United States.\n\nThe album was recorded at Blueprint Studios in Manchester, and is the first Elbow album to be entirely self-produced, mixed and recorded without any outside help. The bulk of the record was written and performed by the band, besides a guest appearance from singer-songwriter Richard Hawley who contributes to guest vocals, lead guitar and co-songwriting on The Fix.\n\nThe title of the album is taken from a lyric in the first single, Grounds for Divorce. It also is a nickname, given by Guy Garvey's father, for Bryan Glancy, a fellow Mancunian musician and friend of the band who died suddenly in 2006. The closing track, Friend of Ours and the liner notes of the album are dedicated in his memory. \n\nThe album won the 2008 Mercury Music Prize. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elbow/The+Seldom+Seen+Kid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
