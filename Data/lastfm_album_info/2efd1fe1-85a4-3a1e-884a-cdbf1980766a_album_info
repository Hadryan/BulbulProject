Additionally, with only two songs under the five-minute mark, this is maybe their most \"cinematic\"-sounding record to date.\n\nThis album marks the first release by Mogwai to be completely instrumental. In an interview with Scottish magazine The Skinny, Barry Burns explained: “It’s only if we have a song that doesn’t sound as if it’s finished that we’ll try and put samples, singing or spoken stuff over it. We just didn’t feel like it needed it this time. We’ve always been thought of as an instrumental band, and now, after ten years, we’ve finally delivered,”\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mogwai/The+Hawk+is+Howling\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
