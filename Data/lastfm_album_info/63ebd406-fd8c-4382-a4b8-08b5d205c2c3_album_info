From the achingly beautiful opener 'To Build A Home' to the finale, 'Time And Space', this is an album which reaches for and finds a truth and honesty far beyond what you would normally expect from such a record, but without losing any of the accessibility which made TCO popular in the first place. If the mood is melancholy, Swinscoe and the musicians he works with manage to make it an ultimately uplifting experience, perhaps in the end more about the love you find than the love you lose.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n    * 1.
