The name of the album according to member Thomas Humser refers to two things. One meaning is that \"tripper\" is the slang term for a traveler. It is also a Danish meaning for shuffling one's feet in anticipation or something good to happen. The album cover was done by Marie Hill and is literally a mashing of doodle she drew. The logo of the child dancing next to the band's name apparently is supposed to represent the supposed childlike approach to this music. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Efterklang/Tripper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Tripper is the 2004 debut album by the Danish group Efterklang.
