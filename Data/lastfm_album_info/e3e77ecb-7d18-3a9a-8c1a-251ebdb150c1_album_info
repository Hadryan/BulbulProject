Produced by bass guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, the album's title refers to vocalist Ed Droste's mother's house where the majority of recording took place. The album is the first to feature both Taylor and vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen, and received critical acclaim upon its release; significantly increasing the band's exposure. An EP, Friend, was released the following year featuring material recorded mostly during the same sessions. Following the release of Horn of Plenty in 2004, Grizzly Bear expanded from being the solo moniker for vocalist Ed Droste into a full band, with the addition of Horn of Plenty collaborator Christopher Bear, bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, and guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen. Christopher Bear noted, \"Getting together the band for the live show changed things quite a bit, in terms of dynamics and instrumentation used. The songs [on Horn of Plenty] were quite simple and open ended so it left a lot of room for interpretation, which was great because it allowed us to get a band sound happening and working on a very reactionary level.\"\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Grizzly+Bear/Yellow+House\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
