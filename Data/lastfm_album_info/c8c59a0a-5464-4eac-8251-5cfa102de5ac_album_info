In that band is Ian's brother Alec MacKaye.\n    * Under the tray of the first pressing of the Dirty CD (and later in the booklet of the deluxe edition CD and LP) is a controversial photograph of performance artist Bob Flanagan. It was removed from all other pressings.\n    * The track \"Sugar Kane\" includes a possible reference to fellow indie rock band Half Japanese. The lyric \"kiss me like a frog\" may refer to the Half Japanese song of the same name.\n    * In the movie The 40 Year Old Virgin, the character Cal played by Seth Rogen is seen in one part of the movie wearing a t-shirt of the album cover.\n    * Sonic Youth's \"JC\" was inspired by Joe Cole's murder, and the Sonic Youth song \"100%\" was dedicated to him. Joe Cole was also a director for their music video \"My Friend Goo\".\n    * The song \"Créme Brûlèe\" is (intentionally?) misspelled; it should be written crème brûlée, as a reference for the french dessert.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Youth/Dirty\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
