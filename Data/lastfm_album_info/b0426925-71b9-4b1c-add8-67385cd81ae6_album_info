Frontman Matt Heafy was 17 years old when the album was written and recorded. Corey Beaulieu toured in support of the album, but did not play on the album according to the re-release booklet.\n\nThe 2005 reissue of the album includes early versions of \"The Deceived\" and \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies\". Both songs were re-recorded for Ascendancy, with the latter appearing only on the 2006 special edition. \"Demon\" is taken from the Trivium \"blue demo\" EP. \"Inception the Bleeding Skies\" is \"A View of Burning Empires\" played in reverse. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Trivium/Ember+To+Inferno\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
