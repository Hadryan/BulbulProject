At the Grammy Awards of 2003 it was nominated for Album of the Year and became Eminem's third straight LP to win the award for Best Rap Album. It has been certified 8x Platinum by the RIAA, has sold over 9.2 million copies in the U.S., and over 19 million albums worldwide. In 2003, the album was ranked number 317 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe Eminem Show was first scheduled for a June 2002 release, however pirated and bootleg copies appeared online on peer-to-peer networks and began surfacing on the streets. Interscope decided to release the album early on May 28 to combat bootlegging. However, many stores in the U.S. began selling it early on Sunday May 26. Despite the confusion over the exact release date, the album still managed to have a wildly successful debut on the charts.\n\nThe album was met with both critical and commercial success. The record became Eminem's third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and also swept the MTV Music Video Awards winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. The Eminem Show was Eminem's most successful album in terms of charting singles. It spawned two top ten and four top fifteen singles with \"Without Me\", \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\", \"Sing For The Moment\" and \"Superman\", which managed to reach the top ten without a video counterpart. \"Business\" was also released as an airplay single but did not chart as high as the others. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/The+Eminem+Show\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
