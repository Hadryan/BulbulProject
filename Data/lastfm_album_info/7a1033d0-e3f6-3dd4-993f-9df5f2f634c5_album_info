Hotel was recorded and mixed at Moby's apartment, Electric Lady Studios, and Loho Studios in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nInitial quantities of the album came with a second CD of ambient music entitled Hotel: Ambient.\n\nThe album name Hotel was explained in one of Moby's journal entries. The artist was fascinated by the nature of hotels, where humans spend often significant portions of their lives, but have all traces of their tenancy removed for the next guests.\n\nNotably, Hotel is the first Moby album in several years that does not contain any vocal samples. The album showcases a wide range of genres, from electronic to disco. Moby is responsible for playing the instruments on all the tracks, except for drumming. Laura Dawn provides additional vocals. Notable tracks include the first UK single \"Lift Me Up\" (released February 28, 2005) and a slow ballad cover of New Order's \"Temptation\".\n\nThe second single, \"Spiders,\" was released on May 23, 2005 to coincide with Moby's UK tour.\n\nAs with Moby's previous albums, Play and 18, there was a Hotel DVD featuring the videos for the singles, a live concert, and a sequel to Moby's home movie/tour diary series, Give An Idiot A Camcorder <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Moby/Hotel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
