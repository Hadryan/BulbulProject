An experienced narcotics detective and his inexperienced partner go after an elusive drug dealer. They become drug addicts themselves and, failing to get the evidence they need, are forced to use falsified evidence.\n\nSeasoned undercover narcotics police officer Jim Raynor (Jason Patric) must choose a new partner for his next assignment. He chooses the \"wet-behind-the-ears\" Kristen Cates (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Together they are looking to bring down the so-far untouchable Gaines (Gregg Allman).\n\nAs they get deeper and deeper undercover they become addicted to the same heroin they're trying to keep off the street; they also fall in love, further complicating their assignment.\n\nLacking real evidence, they are forced to create false evidence in order to get a conviction. Later Raynor is murdered by an unseen hitman. At Gaines' trial for Raynor's murder, just as Cates is asked to deliver a key piece of testimony Gaines reveals that he was either the unseen hitman or is in direct contact with him by tracing his own face with two fingers-the exact way the two barrels of the killer's shotgun traced hers at Raynor's murder. She immediately recants her grand-jury testimony, freeing Gaines. Gaines is later murdered by an unseen assassin whom we assume is officer Cates.\n\n\nCredits\n\nJimmy Bralower -- Drum Machine\nHillary Bratton -- Film Music Coordinator\nJeff Carson -- Film Music Editor\nLenny Castro -- Percussion\nBill Champlin -- Vocals (bckgr)\nEd Cherney -- Engineer\nEric Clapton -- Dobro, Guitar, Arranger, Composer, Vocals, Writer\nLee Dickson -- Guitar Technician\nTim Drummond -- Bass\nBruce Dukov -- Concert Master\nNathan East -- Bass\nSteve Ferrone -- Drums\nBen Fowler -- Assistant Engineer\nDavid Frank -- Synthesizer, Arranger, Horn, Synthesizer Horn\nLani Groves -- Vocals (bckgr)\nBuddy Guy -- Guitar, Vocals, Performer\nAlex Haas -- Mixing\nTed Jensen -- Mastering\nRandy Kerber -- Organ, Synthesizer, Arranger, Conductor, Keyboards, Orchestration\nRobbie Kondor \tSynthesizer\nChuck Leavell -- Organ, Piano\nGayle Levant -- Celtic Harp\nScott Mabuchi -- Engineer\nBecky Mancuso -- Music Supervisor\nJayDee Mannes -- Pedal Steel\nJenni Muldaur -- Vocals (bckgr)\nAmos Newman -- Associate Producer\nRichard Ornstein -- Assistant Engineer\nGreg Phillinganes -- Piano, Keyboards\nDonna Ranieri -- Soundtrack Coordination\nCelest Ray -- Music Clearance\nTim Sexton -- Music Supervisor\nVaneese Thomas -- Vocals (bckgr)\nRuss Titelman -- \tArranger, Producer\nTom Winslow -- Assistant Engineer\nKayla Ritt Yamada -- Production Assistant\nLili Fini Zanuck -- Executive Producer\n\n\nCast\n\n    * Jason Patric as Jim Raynor\n    * Jennifer Jason Leigh as Kristen Cates\n    * Sam Elliott as Dodd\n    * Max Perlich as Walker\n    * Gregg Allman as Will Gaines\n    * Tony Frank as Nettle\n    * William Sadler as Monroe\n    * Dennis Letts as Senior District Attorney\n    * Dennis Burkley as Motorcycle Guy\n    * Merrill Connally as Defense Attorney\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\nEric Clapton's Grammy-winning song Tears in Heaven is featured in the film. Clapton wrote the entire film's soundtrack, which is entirely instrumental, except for Tears in Heaven and Help Me Up, Jimi Hendrix's All Along the Watchtower (composed by Bob Dylan), Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\", Buddy Guy and Eric Clapton's \"Don't Know Which Way to Go\", Freddy Fender's \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\", Robin Trower's \"Bridge of Sighs\", The Ohio Players' \"Love Rollercoaster\", and Johnny Winter's \"Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo\".\n\n\nFactual basis\n\nRush is based on the infamous Tyler, Texas  drug scandal of the late 1970's, when two police undercover officers (Wozencraft and her partner, later her husband) were brought in from the Plano  Police Department and were assigned to break up a huge smuggling ring that was suspected to be run by a Tyler club owner by the name of Bora. Most of what happens in the movie happened in real life, from the addiction getting out of control to the use of planted evidence. However, the movie never explored the role of U.S. Assistant Attorney Kelly Ireland and how he found out about the problem from a casual conversation with a Texas Ranger at a meeting in Fort Worth, and how he pursued it at great cost to his own career and life. But, even though that is left out, the movie reflects what really happened - the Tyler PD being torn in two between the officers who thought what they did was necessary and those who thought what they did was inexcusable, and the same divisions within the community. Kim Wozencraft ran into Kelly Ireland on an airplane many years later and asked forgiveness, which he readily gave, and a recommendation, which he would never give after what she did. They were both sentenced to prison, being released in 1983, and then placed in witness protection. Bora, the club owner, was finally released from prison on his sentence from the tainted charges brought by the two detectives, and did not get killed, as the club owner in the movie does. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
