Variously reported as the band's best-selling album, although others claim that \"Ammonia Avenue\" gets this honor.\n\nVocal performers were Eric Woolfson, David Paton, Chris Rainbow, Lenny Zakatek, Elmer Gantry and Colin Blunstone.\n\n\"Eye in the Sky\" contained the Project's greatest hit, the title track, which had lead vocals by Eric Woolfson and hit #3 on the Billboard charts in the US and #6 in Canada. Says Parsons of the song, \"...I hated the song when we first started recording it — I was quite ready to drop it altogether. Then we hit upon the hypnotic guitar chugs and it all came together.\"\n\nThis album also contains the well known instrumental piece \"Sirius\" which has been featured at sporting events throughout the US. The track is best remembered for its use by the Chicago Bulls to introduce its starting lineup (including Michael Jordan) during its championship years of the 1990s. German football club Eintracht Frankfurt also used the song for player introductions. It is also featured as the entrance music for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, the Iowa State Cyclones, the NFL's Detroit Lions, legendary professional wrestler Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat and as of the 07/08 Premiership Season for the English football team Manchester City. A version of this song has also been used on the early 90s football arcade game \"Super High Impact\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Alan+Parsons+Project/Eye+In+The+Sky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
