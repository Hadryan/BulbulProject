The album was a huge commercial success, earning a gold record and reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 200. Despite this, its producer, Paul Rothchild, considered it a commercial failure, even if it was an artistic triumph: \"We all thought it was the best album. Significantly, it was also the one with the weakest sales. We were confident it was going to be bigger than anything The Beatles had done. But, there was no single. The record died on us.\" Nonetheless, the album managed two Top 30 hits, a Top 3 placing on the US charts, and a platinum certification. Furthermore, the album certainly did nothing to derail the overall success of the Doors, as demonstrated the next year by their chart-topping follow-up Waiting for the Sun.\n\n\"Strange Days\" partially consists of songs that did not make it onto their debut album, such as \"Moonlight Drive\", which was one of the first songs written by Jim Morrison for The Doors. The song was recorded in 1965 (demo) and 1966 (intended for their first album). In 1967 a final version was recorded and released on this album. Strange Days contains some of The Doors' most psychedelic songs. It includes songs such as \"Strange Days\", \"People Are Strange\", \"Love Me Two Times\" and \"When the Music's Over\". The latter is an epic poem that is comparable to the famous \"The End\".\n\nThe album was #3 in the US in 1967, and is #407 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \"People Are Strange\" shot to #12 on the US chart, and \"Love Me Two Times\" followed it, going to #25, thus proving The Doors' staying power after the runaway success of their debut. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Doors/Strange+Days\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
