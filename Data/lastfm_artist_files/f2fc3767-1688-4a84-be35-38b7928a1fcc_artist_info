The band's debut, Any Other City, recorded by Scottish producer Andy Miller, was released in 2001 in the UK; DCBaltimore 2012 issued it months later in the United States. In May 2007 a live album was released in Europe called Live at the Annandale Hotel on the Gargleblast Records label. The album has subsequently been released in North America on Absolutely Kosher Records in August 2007.  Impressed after their first London gig, the Rough Trade-affiliated Tugboat label asked the band to record a debut single on the label.\n\nThe band broke up in 2002 for unknown reasons. Despite the fact that they existed for only three years, Life Without Buildings has developed a strong underground following, with their only LP Any Other City widely admired in many critical circles.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/lifewithoutbuildingsuk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Life+Without+Buildings\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
