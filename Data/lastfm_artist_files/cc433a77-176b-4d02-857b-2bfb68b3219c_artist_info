The band's name in Japanese consists of two words, \"asobi\" meaning \"play\" or \"for fun\", and \"sekkusu\" the Japanese transliterated word for \"sex\".\n\nTheir sound has been said to draw influence from the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s to early 1990s, which was coined to describe the textured and effects-heavy sound of alternative rock in that era.\n\nAsobi Seksu released their eponymous debut album in 2004. The band regrouped with a new rhythm section for their second album, Citrus, which was recorded in Gigantic Studios, New York City with producer Chris Zane.\n\nOne Little Indian Records re-released the band's first album Asobi Seksu and the follow-up Citrus in 2006.\n\nThe band changed its name to Asobi Seksu from the previous name Sportfuck when they signed to their current label.\n\nThe band announced an indefinite hiatus on September 30, 2013, but hinted that they hope to create more music eventually.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Asobi+Seksu\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
