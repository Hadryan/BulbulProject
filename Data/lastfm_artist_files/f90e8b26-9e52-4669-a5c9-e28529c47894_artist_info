Snoop is best known as a famous MC in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of producer Dr. Dre's most notable protégés. He made his rap debut in 1992 on Dre's debut album The Chronic, and then released his debut album, Doggystyle, to much critical and public acclaim. His mother nicknamed him \"Snoopy\" as a child, and he took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg when he began recording. He changed his name to Snoop Dogg in 1996 when he left his original record label, Death Row Records, and signed with No Limit Records.  \n\nHe has been affiliated with the Crips, a U.S. street gang. Several of his cousins, including RBX, Nate Dogg, Daz Dillinger, and Warren G are also hip hop artists and often collaborate with Snoop. In 2000, Snoop (as \"Michael J. Corleone\") directed Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle, a pornographic film produced by Hustler. This film, combining hip-hop with X-rated material, was a huge success and won \"Top Selling Release of the Year\" at the 2002 AVN Awards. Driven by this success, Snoop directed Snoop Dogg's Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp in 2002 (this time using the nickname \"Snoop Scorsese\").\n\nAs a rapper, he is perhaps best known for his “lazy drawl” — a slurred, distinctively calm, laid-back, and rhythmically-complex lyrical delivery.  His lyrics have often been criticized for their glorification of misogyny, violence and gangsterism; however, he is often credited for accurately portraying street slang and attitudes.\n\nSnoop Dogg has a Funk themed side - project in which he calls himself  Snoopzilla\n\nSnoop Dogg has a reggae themed side-project in which he calls himself Snoop Lion. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Snoop+Dogg\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
