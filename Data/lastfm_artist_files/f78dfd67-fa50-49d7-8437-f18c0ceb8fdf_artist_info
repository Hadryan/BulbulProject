Born in Moscow and raised in Alaska, Bell began playing the piano at age 7. As a classical pianist she performed with the Anchorage Symphony and was a fellow of the Aspen Music Festival, the Banff Centre, and Yale's Norfolk chamber music program. In 2005 Bell graduated from the New England Conservatory, moved to New York, bought an Apple computer and began chopping beats and writing songs using GarageBand. \n\nIn 2008 BELL recorded, produced and self-released a 6-track EP that earned accolades from Spin, Gorilla vs. Bear and Stereogum. With drummers Gunnar Olsen and Jason Nazary, Bell toured nationally in 2009, playing Brooklyn Vegan's SXSW showcase and releasing a vinyl single (\"Magic Tape\") on TwoSyllable Records. Later that year Olga was described by the New York Times as a \"powerful advocate\" following the premiere of three songs for voice, electronics and chamber ensemble that were co-written with composer Jeremy Flower and performed at Carnegie Hall. \n\nBELL's debut full-length \"Diamonite\" was self-released on May 31, 2011. It was recorded and produced primarily by Olga Bell and Gunnar Olsen in Brooklyn. Bell partnered with digital artist Zach Lieberman in August 2011 and created a video for single \"Chase No Face\" in which an LED projector, hacked Kinect and openFrameworks code create musically expressive light masks that respond to movement and volume in real-time. \n\nBell's sound resembles fellow northerner Bj√∂rk, as well as Feist, and Radiohead. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
