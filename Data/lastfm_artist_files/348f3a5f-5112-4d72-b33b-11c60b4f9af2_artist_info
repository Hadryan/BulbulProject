Newman has received a total of twelve Academy Award nominations. He has won two BAFTAs, six Grammys and an Emmy, and has been nominated for three Golden Globes. Newman was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the 2000 BMI Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer who has made significant contributions to film and television music.\n \n\nHis uncle Lionel Newman scored Hello, Dolly!. His brother David Newman scored Anastasia, Daddy Day Care, Death to Smoochy, and Ice Age. His cousin Randy Newman is noted for series of popular albums.\nMusical Style\nOne of the most interesting things about Newman is his change of styles, beginning with his score for American Beauty, which received critical acclaim. Before this, Newman gravitated more towards the orchestra for his music, like in most other film music. However, in American Beauty his fans witnessed his take on a minimalistic score with an array of odd instruments and a rhythmic style. Since then Newman has alternated and mixed in both his traditional sweeping orchestral scores along with his new, creative style. He is notorious among score listeners for using plenty of instruments the average listener would never have heard of. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Thomas+Newman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
