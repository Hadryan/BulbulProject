Born in Hereford, she grew up in Kington, Herefordshire and currently lives in London, England.\n\nAfter studying drama at the University of Kent for a couple of years, Goulding moved to West London for the purpose of developing her songs and music career. Touring since 2008 she released her debut single \"Under the Sheets\" on 15 November 2009. The track was produced by Starsmith, with whom she has been working since the beginning of her career.
