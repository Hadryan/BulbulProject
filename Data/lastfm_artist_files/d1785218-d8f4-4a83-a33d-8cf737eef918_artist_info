His debut, 'Now You Know', was released in 2001 on the influential Miami-based Merck Records and gained worldwide attention and praise from musicians, fans and critics in the IDM scene. It was heralded as the \"standard to which the next wave of imitators aspires\" by Pitchfork.\n\nHaving a strong background in both acoustic and electronic instrumentation, he dances between those elements on all his releases. This can be heard in the field recording and vintage synth laden 'Urban Biology' to his seminal production and mixing of the 'This Charming Mixtape' with Theophilus London. His critically acclaimed 2009 album 'Want to 1 2?' was another showcase of his most recent production. In 2010, Machinedrum released 'Many Faces' EP on Scottish label LuckyMe.\n\nUnder the name Sepalcure, heâ€™s also released two EP's - 'Love Pressure EP' and 'Fleur EP' - on Hotflush with friend and collaborator Praveen Sharma - a sound they describe as \"an exploration of chopped up 90's diva house acapellas and wooden sounding snares reminiscent of UK funky and dubstep\". He also saw the EP single release of 'Let It', one of the standout songs from his 2009 'Want to 1 2?' album, with upstart label Innovative Leisure. He also wrote the song 'Outside the Lines' with Praveen Sharma and recorded it under the name Sepalcure featuring Angelica Bess for the 2010 feature film Black Swan, though it is not featured on the official soundtrack to the film.\n\nPlease visit the Machine Drum page, scroll down to 'Suggest a correction' and choose 'Machinedrum'.
