The band's second album, Junip, was released in April 2013.\n\nThe band's sound may be familiar to those who have listened to José González’s critically acclaimed solo records, with organs, synths, and drums featured alongside his nylon-stringed guitar and distinctive voice.  The songs are often dynamic, melodic and shadowy, with a remarkable sonic approach that is simultaneously intimate and atmospheric. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Junip\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
