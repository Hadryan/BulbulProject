They released two albums on Capricorn Records, Stillwater (1977), which included the single \"Mind Bender\", and I Reserve The Right! (1979). They opened for such bands as the Atlanta Rhythm Section and the Charlie Daniels Band. They broke up shortly after the loss of Capricorn Records. They reformed with drummer David Heck and released the album Running Free in (1997).\n\nAfter the band broke up, Rob Walker enlisted in the Air Force Band of New England, Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire. He is still in service, currently stationed in Active Duty with the Band of the US Air Force Reserve at Robins Air Force Base. He has performed with many great musicians as a result, including pianist Kevin Joseph Barnett (Kevin J. Barnett).\n\nMike Causey can still be seen playing around Warner Robins. Al Scarborough plays bass with a band called The Wall in Warner Robins and Macon Ga. Rob Walker occasionally drops in to play with The Wall too. David Heck currently lives and performs in Denver, CO. Bob Spearman, who also played with The Wall, died of cancer. - wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillwater_(band)).\n\n=============================================================\n\nCameron Crowe's 2000 movie, Almost Famous, left some wondering if Stillwater was a real band or not. The answer is yes, but the band featured in the movie was completely fictional and based on several groups that Crowe covered for Rolling Stone during the early '70s (namely the Eagles and Led Zeppelin, among others). The 'real' Stillwater was an obscure multi-membered southern rock, that featured a triple guitar team of Mike Causey (guitar), Bobby Golden (guitar, vocals), and Rob Walker (guitar), plus Jimmy Hall (vocals, percussion), Allison Scarborough (bass, vocals), Bob Spearman (keyboards, vocals), and Sebie Lacey (drums). Originally formed in Georgia during 1973, Stillwater issued only a pair of albums during the late '70s - 1977's self titled debut and 1979's I Reserve the Right! - and narrowly missed scoring a top 40 hit single with the track \"Mind Bender.\" Between the near-hit single and steady opening gigs for the Atlanta Rhythm Section and the Charlie Daniels Band (the latter of which was riding high at the time with their monster crossover hit \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\"), Stillwater seemed to be on the right track for breakthrough success. But when their record label, Capricorn Records, hit upon hard times, Stillwater found themselves without a label, and broke up soonafter. 1997 saw several live tracks from 1978 included on the Alive Down South multi-artist collection, which was followed by a Stillwater reunion the same year. A new album Running Free, was released a year later, and the group has began to play live shows once more. Just before shooting began on Crowe's Almost Famous, the director had to clear the use of the name 'Stillwater' with the band, which they agreed to after reading the script. ~-Greg Prato (http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/stillwater/497718). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stillwater\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
