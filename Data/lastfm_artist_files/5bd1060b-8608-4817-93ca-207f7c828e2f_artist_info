The metal was flowing in our veins,\" comments Max. \"It was the same in the studio.\"\n\n\nIn early January, 2008, Inflikted's tracklist was revealed. A B-side cover of the Possessed death/thrash classic, The Exorcist, was also recorded. A single for Sanctuary was released on March 3, 2008.\n\n\nMembers:\nMax Cavalera (Rhythm Guitar & Vocals)\nIgor Cavalera (Drums)\nMarc Rizzo (Lead Guitar) (also plays in Soulfly)\nJoe Duplantier (Bass) (also plays in Gojira)\n\n\nLinks:\nOfficial Website: http://www.cavaleraconspiracy.com\nRoadrunner Records Artist Page <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cavalera+Conspiracy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
