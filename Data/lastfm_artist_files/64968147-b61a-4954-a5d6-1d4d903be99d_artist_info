The band consist of three members: producer/DJ Embee and the lyricists Promoe & Supreme.\n\nThey were four members but Cosm.i.c has left the group. His appearance on \"Fort Europa\" (Album) was his last. Read about it on http://www.looptrooprockers.com\n\nDj Mc Marshall (later to be known as EMBEE) and his classmate Marcie Cee shared a newfound love of hip-hop music in the early 90s. The rest of the jerks in the school didn't get it, and the two were both excited about having something that was their own and eager to let some more people in on the secret. One day they would laugh about who in school looked least likely to be able to rap. They soon decided it was definitely that longhaired, loud-mouthed, tight jeans wearing dude in the 8th grade: Mc Mårten (Promoe).\n\nSome months later Dj Mc Marshall and Mc Mårten recorded their first song, and many more were to come. They would team up with two other young guys from their hometown of Västerås, Sweden and eventually take on the name Looptroop that now reigns supreme over nearly every continent. Mellow T (Cosmic) was one of the two guys that joined forces with them. He used to be in another Västerås crew called The Hot Dogs, and before that it was Groovy Soundsystem.\n\n\"I remember seeing Cosmic battling some of his old crew members at a highschool disco,\" reminisces Promoe. \"This was before I knew him, and I have a clear memory of how the kids he was battling were reading their lyrics off big pieces of paper on the stage floor while performing. I was not impressed.\"\n\n\"Supreme joined the crew some years later,\" says Embee, \"[we] met at different house parties around town. He was in a hardcore band called Aggressive Contrast and I invited him to make a song, or rather kick a verse or two, at The Wax Cabinet. Up till this day he still refuses to listen to that first recording and even when we listen to old Looptroop songs that we recorded before he was in the group he runs out like his pants are on fire.\"\n\nNow, 14 years after Embee and Promoe took their first stumbling steps into the world of music, and seven years after Looptroop founded their record company David vs. Goliath it's time for the third Looptroop album called Fort Europa to be released to the public. It's been almost 40 releases from the DvsG's, most recently Promoe's Long Distance Runner and White Man's Burden, Embee's Grammy award winning Tellings From Solitaria, and Looptroop's Fort Europa. They've continued their collaboration with punk label Burning Heart Records that will license the new album just as they did Modern Day City Symphony (2000) and The Struggle Continues (2002). Looptroop, Embee, and Promoe works closely with the sound and mixing masters at Soundism since a few years.\n\n9/2-2007, Cosm.i.c announced that he is no longer a member of the Looptroop crew. \nHe announced that he was leaving because of all the travelling and not being together with his family as much as he wanted to. He also said that there's no ongoing beef between the members and that he loves his crew like they were his own brothers.\n\nAs a consequence of Cosm.i.c leaving the band, they changed the name to Looptroop Rockers, under which the 2008 album \"Good Things\" has been released.\n\n\nDiscography\nMain Albums\n\n    * Modern Day City Symphony (2000)\n    * The Struggle Continues (2002)\n    * Fort Europa (2005)\n    * Good Things (23. april 2008) (released under the name Looptroop Rockers)\n\nSingles\n\n    * Ambush in the Night b/w Heed This Warning (f/ Freestyle of the Arsonists) (1999)\n    * Looptroopland b/w Heads Day Off (2001)\n\nTapes\n\n    * Superstars (1993)\n    * Threesicksteez (1995)\n    * From the Waxcabinet (1996)\n    * Punx Not Dead (1998)\n\n12\" vinyl\n\n    * Don't Hate The Player (xxxx)\n    * Fly Away (xxxx)\n    * Looptroopland (xxxx)\n    * Ambush in the night (xxxx)\n\nSolo Albums and Side Projects\n\nPromoe\n\n\n    * Off the Record (single) b/w It's Promoe/Poor Lonesome Homeboy (1999)\n    * Government Music (2001)\n    * The Long Distance Runner (2004)\n    * White Man's Burden (2006)\n    * Standard Bearer (2007)\n\nEmbee\n\n    * Tellings From Solitaria (2004)\n\nThe Casual Brothers (Embee and Cosmic)\n\n    * The Casual Brothers (2001)\n    * Customer's Choice (2003)\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Looptroop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
