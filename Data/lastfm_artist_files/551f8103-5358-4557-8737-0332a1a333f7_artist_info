They are comprised of Dan Carney (guitar, vocals), Giles Littleford (guitar, vocals), Chin Keeler (drums) , Laura Copsey (brass, electronics, vocals) and Michael Cranny (bass, vocals). Their music is influenced by atmospheres, the quest for a killer vocal harmony and a constant desire to make their hearts beat ever so slightly faster than normal. \n\nThe ‘Circles’ EP (June 2008) received radio support from the likes of Zane Lowe, Rob da Bank (Radio 1), Mark Radcliffe (Radio 2) and John Kennedy (Xfm), and was featured as experimental Single Of The Month in Mixmag. \n\nDebut album ‘Miracle Kicker’ (October 2008) was co-produced by Robin Proper-Sheppard (The God Machine, Sophia) and showcased the band’s penchant for spine-tingling harmonies, electronic drones, gently picked folksy guitar and huge psychedelic endings. \n\n‘Jealous Enemies’ (September 2008) was Single Of The Week on Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie’s Radio 2 show, and Download of The Week on US iTunes, garnering a fair few sales stateside. ‘Miracle Kicker’ placed at #33 in The Guardian’s Top 50 albums of 2008.\n\n2009 saw more UK touring and a remix EP which featured blissed-out reworkings of ‘Miracle Kicker’ tracks from the likes of US electronic legend Hatchback. In September 2009 the band embarked on a short but successful tour of Germany and Austria in support of Robin Proper-Sheppard’s Sophia. ‘Mid-Session Interval’, the b-side to the original ‘Jealous Enemies’ single release, was also heard soundtracking a Royal Bank of Scotland TV advert.\n\nThe band have spent most of 2010 shutting themselves away and working on album number two. Expect gigs and plenty of new material from January 2011 onwards. \n\nSelected press quotes...\n\n'There are countless acts out there weaving folk tinged melodies and circling acoustic guitars with electronic chimes and beats but you'll have to go a long way to hear it done with this level of emotion and originality or with such delicate vocal harmonies'. MixMag (‘Circles’ alt./experimental Single of the Month 6/08)\n\n'Underneath the menace of the bleak (but very tuneful) acoustic guitar/laptop/trumpet battles lurks Dan Carney's occasionally weary tales of quite but definite personal hysteria, all told in a sweet estuary twang...a charming record and one liable to sting you if you're not paying attention'. The Fly Magazine\n'A sweetness infuses every song as the vocal harmonies blend over the crisp, acoustic=electric arrangements' Plan B\n\n' ...boasting tuneful acoustic guitar melodies and subtle yet effective trademarked wisping vocals...when you play this CD you often forget it;s actually on but when it finishes one feels slightly alone and you have to put it on again..' Clash Magazine (‘Miracle Kicker’ album of the month 10/08)\n\n'Like a rustic Air adrift in a haze of woozy acoustica, DCLC's debut washes over the listener, the Wicker Man-style soundscapes smothered by multilayered harmonies that sigh with vague unease' Q Magazine\n\n'Nu-folk wannabes are clogging up our arteries at the moment but you can't switch off and miss a gem like this. DCLC specialise in acidy, harmony-drenched acoustics. Lilting like Simon & Garfunkel over ominous guitar picks and swooning strings, it's a delicious face-off between dark and light. If an album's worth of psych-pop-folk meandering sounds too much, just listen to Questions... and beg for more later'.
