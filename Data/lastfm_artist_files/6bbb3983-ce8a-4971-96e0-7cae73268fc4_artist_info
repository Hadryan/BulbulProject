London electrocrooning duo Jungle have perhaps the best marketing strategy in recent memory for a new band. With virtually no recognition outside of their home country and no releases yet to their name, last summer they quietly debuted the music video for their song “Platoon” on Vimeo and let B-Girl Terra, the six-year-old breakdancing viral sensation, do the rest of the work. By September, the video was popping up on Facebook news feeds the world over.\n\n2. Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan – “Jungle” is a world/rock/fusion power trio featuring Steve \"Muruga\" Booker on drums, Dave Sharp on bass, and Steven Springer on guitar. “Jungle” was formed in 2010 when Muruga, Dave, and Steven collaborated on a project at Muruga’s \"Sage Ct.\" recording studio. While in studio they recorded their first album “Jungle.” Drawing from many influences like Coltrane, Hendrix, Funkadelic etc. they recorded the album live.\n\nSteven \"Muruga\" Booker, born in Detroit, MI, is a world renowned drummer and percussionist with musical roots going back to the late 1950's when he played in the Detroit rock n roll band “The Low Rocks.” Muruga was inspired by the blues, rock, and soul of the Detroit scene. He played with the legendary bluesman John Lee Hooker. They were booked as Hooker and Booker. Muruga is also known for his drum solos at venues like the East Town and Chessmate in Detroit. Playing with many artists throughout his career some highlights include playing Woodstock in 1969 with Tim Hardin, performing at Carnegie Hall with Dave Brubeck, playing on Weather Reports “Sweet Nighter” in 1973, and collaborating with George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars from the late 70's to the present. In 1990 Muruga released the billboard charting album \"Blues from the Rainforest\" with Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia. In 1991 he was a recipient of th Hiroshima Voices for Peace award. He is featured on the Chesky Records album \"Circle of Drums\" with Babatunde Olatunji and Sikiru Adepoju. Most recently Muruga has released several albums on the Italian label Qbico Records and his 2010 release \"Kiss of Peace\" is nominated for 2010 Detroit Music Award for outstanding world music recording.\n\nSteven Springer grew up in Port of Spain, Trinidad and is an accomplished, soulful songwriter and innovative finger style guitarist, with his roots in reggae, soca and calypso. His unique musical style is a melting pot of jazz, reggae, Latin, blues, rock and R&B, which combine to form a refreshing exceptional sound. When watching Springer perform, audiences from around the world have been witnessed an artist delivering his music with energy, conviction and raw emotion. Born in Trinidad, in the West Indies, Steven Springer was inspired by the melodic lilting sound of soca and calypso. He started playing guitar at a young age. Steven was intrigued by the fusion of many cultures and the beautiful natural features of Trinidad. In his early twenties, Steven moved to Phoenix, Arizona and formed a band called Sanctuary. Touring worldwide, Springer was a featured artist at the 1988 World’s Fair in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, performing with the Trinidad Calypso Band. Upon returning to the United States, Springer joined Hugh Borde’s world famous Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band, performing and recording with them for over ten years. Currently, Steven also leads the band Tropicooljazz. Among other numerous awards and honors, Steven was chosen “Best Guitar Player,” every year from 1990 to 1993, at the annual Detroit Music Awards.\n\nDave Sharp, a native Detroiter, became devoted to jazz at the University of Michigan and gained his chops under the tutelage of renowned bassist Herbie Lewis (McCoy Tyner, Cannonball Adderly and Les McCann) in San Francisco, and virtuoso bassist, composer and bandleader Marion Hayden (Straight Ahead) in Detroit. As bassist and composer for the modern jazz ensemble “Spheres of In uence,” and touring bassist for the seminal rock band “The Melvins” (Atlantic Records), Sharp has already made a mark on the national scene. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he composes, records, teaches and performs with Jungle has his own band Dave Sharp's Secret Seven.\n\n\n\n3.Nothing is known about this excellent late sixties album's makers. A reissue is now available, so you can hear how good it is for yourself! Early Morning Rising, Slave Ship, House Of Rooms and Gray Picnic are all loaded with nice guitar and organ, even frantic (if somewhat inept) drumming on occasion. The tracks have an atmospheric, open quality and the recording is superb. This is a lost gem. The reissue has a deluxe embossed cover. It was originally issued in a plain sleeve.\n\n(Clark Faville for \"Fuzz, Acid and Flowers\" book) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jungle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
