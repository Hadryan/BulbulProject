The band took their name from the Eloi, a futuristic race of people in the H.G. Wells novel The Time Machine.\n\nFounded in 1969 by guitarist Frank Bornemann, the band has endured several line-up changes, with Bornemann being the only consistent member of the group. In the 1980s, after a series of major splits (like in 1984 although reformed in 1988) in the group, Bornemann pursued a more commercial direction. Despite attracting a large following, the band never gained popularity in the United States.\n\nHowever, in later years, former members of the band re-joined, and in 1998 fans delighted in hearing Ocean 2, a return to the classic symphonic progressive genre that the band was so well known for. A sequel to the 1977's original, it is commonly thought among fans that it successfully recaptures the spirit of the band, and is a worthy follow-up to the much beloved classic.\n\nOf the band's numerous records, fans generally consider Inside, Floating, Dawn, Ocean, Silent Cries & Mighty Echoes, Planets and Ocean 2 to be the superior albums.\n\nDespite their nationality, the band is not generally considered krautrock due to their sound which has much more in common with English progressive groups such as Pink Floyd and Yes.\n\nIn 2009 Frank Bornemann released a DVD celebrating their 40th anniversary.\nAlso there is a new album released, called 'Visionairy'.\n\nCurrent Line-up:\nFrank Bornemann\nKlaus-Peter Matziol\nHannes Arkona\nHannes Folberth\nBodo Schopf <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eloy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
