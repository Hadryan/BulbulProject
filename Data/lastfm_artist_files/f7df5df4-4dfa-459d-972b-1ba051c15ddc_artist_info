If you’re Karin Dreijer Andersson, the answer is to take a couple of years off and return as a solo artist under a new name: Fever Ray.\n\nIn Andersson's own words:  “I had so many songs to record that I just had to make an album. I thought I was going to have a longer break but I guess it will never happen. I can't stop working.  My aim was to finish the album and, now that it's done, I'm a bit restless (good that The Knife has an opera to write then).  During the last years, I discovered that I like to sing too, so I hope that my newly found live band Fever Ray will make it to the stages next year. We are rehearsing and building something beautiful and brilliant.\"\n\nSites: Vimeo and MySpace. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fever+Ray\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
