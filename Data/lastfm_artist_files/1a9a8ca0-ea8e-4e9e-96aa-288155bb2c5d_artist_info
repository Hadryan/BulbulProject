Starting in the 60s with the psychedelic band  Nazz in Philadelphia, his solo career started out successfully with such hits as \"I Saw the Light\" and \"Hello It's Me\" (a reworked Nazz tune). With his 1972 release 'Something/Anything?' seen as a magnum opus due to its mix of power pop, rock n roll, and more, Rundgren's new band called Utopia (or Todd Rundgren's Utopia) concentrated on eccentric progressive epics. His acclaimed production effort started early, with work for Sparks and the New York Dolls, and continued with Meat Loaf, XTC, The Psychedelic Furs, and many others. Continuing to release solo albums over the years, he's created many other hits, the novelty tune \"Bang the Drum All Day\" in particular seeming timeless. \n\nTodd Rundgren is well known among his fans as being an electronic music revolutionary. His skilled production techniques, matched by his belief that he has ability to play just about any instrument at a mastery level, has allowed him to release some of the most honest and personal music of his time. Many of his solo albums, including the critically-acclaimed 'Something/Anything?' were made completely by himself. That is, he played all the instruments, sang all the vocals, did all of the recording, editing, mixing, and mastering, and even distributed the album through his own record label, called Bearsville.\n\nOddly enough, the particular case of 'Something/Anything' involved the album actually having one side (side four) that specifically featured songs performed by a studio band, placed on the album to show Todd's ability in working with musicians. For over fourty years now, Rundgren has had a successful musical career that's involved performing with other famous artists. For example, he fronted, recorded, and toured with the group The New Cars, which featured two of his own band members and two of the remaining The Cars members. In addition, he released a solo album in 2004 entitled 'Liars', which featured songs on the recurring theme of deceit and broken promises, and his touring group included his long-time bassist Kasim Sulton being put alongside former The Tubes drummer Prarie Prince.\n\nRundgren's latest work is 'Global', a release set to come out on April 7th, 2015 that has found his name back in the news (not that its ever that far from it in the first place). He also has recently famously collaborated with former Beatle Ringo Starr, both in terms of Starr's studio output and Starr's acclaimed touring. Several music journalists have praised his recent burst of activity as that of a rock n roll veteran, looking forwards to future endeavors.\n\nWebsite: http://www.tr-i.com/\n\nCore discography (live releases not fully represented yet):\n\nWith Nazz:\n1968 - Nazz\n1969 - Nazz Nazz\n1970 - Nazz III\n\nSolo:\n1970 - Runt\n1971 - Runt.
