The material for their first album Sings Reign Rebuilder was created over five days in a dilapidated old apartment in Montreal and is a mixture of improvisation, composition, and environment noises.  Their sophomore double album Telegraphs In Negative / Mouths Trapped In Static was recorded in a barn in rural Ontario; the sounds of the creaking doors and other background noise are heard in the songs.\n\nMany of their tracks are very minimalist in nature, filled with ambient noise and various other non-musical sound effects, juxtaposed or combined with instrumental music.\n\nThe band is often considered a side-project of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, as the two musical ensembles share several members. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Set+Fire+to+Flames\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
