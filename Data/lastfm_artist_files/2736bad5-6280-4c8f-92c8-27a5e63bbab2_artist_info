Originally formed in 2004 by Simon Ward, Stephen Livingstone and Greg Paterson on the back of a 3 track demo recorded in Simon’s bedroom the band quickly set about making a name for themselves in their hometown with their unique take on dance music. The band were soon taken under the wing of Mogwai who signed them to their Rock Action label alongside the likes of Part Chimp and James Orr Complex. In 2005 Errors enlisted ex-Multiplies drummer James Hamilton as a full-time member after he'd become an integral part of their live set-up and also contributed to the band's debut 7\" 'Hans Herman'.\n\nTo date they have released a series of 7” singles, EPs and their debut album ‘It’s Not Something But It Is Like Whatever” through Rock Action. These releases have brought them to the attention of the mainstream media with support and acclaim for the band coming across the board from MTV, DJ’s like Zane Lowe, John Kennedy and Vic Galloway, magazines such as NME, Dazed and Confused and Rock Sound along with sessions at Maida Vale for Mary Anne Hobbs, Rob Da Bank and Huw Stephens. The band have toured extensively with their own sold out headline shows as well as live dates with bands as varied as Underworld, Franz Ferdinand, Explosions In The Sky, Gary Numan and Mogwai.\n\n2009 marked the recording of Errors’ sophomore release; “Come Down With Me” due for release on Rock Action in 2010. Recorded and produced by the band in their customised studio “The Freezer” based in Glasgow’s East End. The record builds on the merged sound of electronic and analogue that has become Errors signature. Angular, spiraling guitars, underpinned by truly mesmerising beats combined with euphoric synths and pop hooks.\n\n‘Come Down With Me’ is an exceptional return from Errors. Expansive, ambitious, intelligent and genre-defying, tracks such as “Bridge or Cloud?”, “Beards” and future single “A Rumour In Africa” are destined to make 2010 as being a landmark year for the band.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/weareerrors <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Errors\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
