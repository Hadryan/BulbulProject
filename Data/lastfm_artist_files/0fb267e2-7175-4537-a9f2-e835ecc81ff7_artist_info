Other influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother's Motown albums and his father's \"chilled out Ibiza CDs\".\nHe first rose to prominence after his cover of Blackstreet's \"No Diggity\" went viral online, reaching #1 on the Hypemachine chart in May 2011. He released his first EP Thinking In Textures in 2012 to positive reviews, being described as \"wonderfully loungey\" and praised for its ability to \"mix subtlety with impressive beauty\". The EP was also popular with fans, with single \"I'm Into You\" landing at number 24 on the 2012 Triple J Hottest 100 chart.\nFaker has worked with several other artists since the release of his debut EP, including collaborations with Flume and remixes of songs by MS MR and The Temper Trap. He was a featured vocalist on Say Lou Lou's \"Fool of Me\", which was named Best New Track by Pitchfork in May 2013.\nHe released a new single featuring Kilo Kish on 12 August 2013. In September of 2013, Flume announced that he and Faker had recorded an EP, stating that the final result \"doesn't sound particularly like Flume or specifically like, you know, a Chet Faker record it really is kinda like a hybrid of both sounds going to one\" and he feels like everything they did with the EP \"was collaborative about the whole effort, and I think that shines through.\" Faker's debut album, \"Built on Glass\", was released on 11 April 2014, which was preceded by the release of lead single \"Talk Is Cheap\" and its accompanying music video on February 11. The album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Charts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Faker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
