The critical reception was generally good, receiving good reviews from NME, Q magazine and Billboard, although they were also accused of lack of imagination and unoriginality for allegedly borrowing ideas from other influential bands, notably The Strokes. They appear to polarize opinion. NME wrote that the album: \"bristles with passion, energy and, most importantly, amazing songs\", while they were described elsewhere as \"nearly everything wrong with rock and roll today\". Their fans, though, embrace the music for its simple melodies and multi-layered, easy-going compositions.\n\nFrontman Johnny Borrell caused some controversy and surprise when he likened himself to musical legend Bob Dylan, quipping \"If Dylan's making the chips then I'm drinking the champagne\". This led to suggestions of self-promotion. This statement was taken out of context however as Borrell was comparing his and Dylan's first albums, not their overall career. The band became very popular on the London music scene when they arrived earlier in the year. Large demand caused the band to play extra shows, including a 7,000+ capacity gig at Alexandra Palace. The album was heavily marketed in the UK.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Razorlight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
