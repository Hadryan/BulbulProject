His debut album Fluence was released in 1975.\n\nComelade born was in Montpellier, France. After living for several years in Barcelona, he made his first album, Fluences, influenced by electronic music and by the group Heldon.\n\nSubsequently, his music has become more acoustic and is characterised by the sounds of toy instruments, used as solo-instruments and as an integral part of the sound of his group, the Bel Canto Orquestra.\n\nHe has collaborated with many singers and musicians from diverse genres of music including Robert Wyatt, Dani, Faust, Christophe Miossec, Toti Soler, Jac Berrocal, and P.J. Harvey to mention just a few.\n\nComelade is considered an adherent of electro acoustic post-modernist music and a follower of Heldon, Brian Eno, Michael Nyman, Robert Wyatt and Carla Bley.\n\nPascal Comelade is a French composer who specializes in a progressive-rock format with childish nuances such as toy instruments. The resulting scores are soundtracks of an imaginary Wonderland, somewhere between Erik Satie and Barry Adamson.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pascal+Comelade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
