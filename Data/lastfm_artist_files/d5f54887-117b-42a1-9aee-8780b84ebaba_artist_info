The band also varies guests on their debut album such as the Crouch End Festival Chorus and The Wired Strings.\n\nSince his split from Oasis in August 2009, many speculated that Gallagher might record a solo album. In July 2011, he held a press conference to confirm that this was the case, after denying rumours made by his brother, Liam Gallagher, that he had already heard the tracks featured. He also explained that he would be collaborating with Amorphous Androgynous for an album that is due for release in the summer of 2012. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Noel+Gallagher%27s+High+Flying+Birds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
