This style has been described as \"Rock meets PowerBook\". Rolling Stone described him as \"the most pictorial composer-programmer in laptop electronica\".\n\nHis oeuvre is far broader though - Hotel Paral.lel won the Prix Ars Electronica Award of Distinction for Digital Musics in 1999 along with Pita's Seven Tons For Free.\n\nFennesz has been recording with Ryuichi Sakamoto, with whom he also plays live, with Keith Rowe, Sparklehorse, Mike Patton, etc... He has also worked alongside Peter Rehberg and Jim O'Rourke in the improvisional trio Fenn O'Berg, and with David Sylvian who sang on his album Venice and for whom Fennesz composed the music for the song \"A Fire in the Forest\" for his album Blemish.\n\nIn November 2008, Christian Fennesz released a new album: Black Sea on the Touch Label. In 2009 Fennesz teamed up with Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) to create In The Fishtank 15. The following year Fennesz released Szampler, a cassette containing his sample collection on the Tapeworm label. This release was later remixed by Stefan Goldmann and released as Goldmann vs. Fennesz: Remiksz.\n\nIn November 2013, Fennesz played the final holiday camp edition of the world famous All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fennesz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
