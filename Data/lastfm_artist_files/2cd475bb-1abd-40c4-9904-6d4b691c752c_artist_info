He left behind a huge and diverse body of work, in which he influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated some twentieth-century ideas and trends. Some of his most notable contributions were the invention of the symphonic poem, developing the concept of thematic transformation as part of his experiments in musical form and making radical departures in harmony. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Liszt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
