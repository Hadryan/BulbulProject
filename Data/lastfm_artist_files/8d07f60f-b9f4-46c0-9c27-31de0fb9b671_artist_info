They consisted of singer and bassist Mark Burgess, guitarist Reg Smithies, guitarist Dave Fielding, and drummer John Lever.\n\nThe band initially released three studio albums in the 1980s, to solid critical acclaim. After their third release, Strange Times, in 1987 they abruptly disbanded following the sudden death of band manager Tony Fletcher. The Chameleons were, for all practical purposes, extinct for well over a decade before releasing - to the delight and even disbelief of its ardently loyal fan base - a final studio album in 2001, entitled Why Call It Anything. The band quickly dissolved once again in 2003 due to personal differences, after a successful reunion tour which took them across Europe and the United States. Though having never attained the level of commercial success or fame enjoyed by their contemporaries (e.g. U2, Echo and the Bunnymen, Joy Division), The Chameleons' early impact can still be felt throughout much of popular music today.\n\nDave Fielding went on to form The Reegs who released a couple of ep's . Then in 2003 formed Coconut Dogfuck  a trance techno dance act with Ralph on percussion, Paul Didge on didge and Dave playing guitar and dulcimer . They released an ep and played festivals and gigs around the uk . Andy Clegg Keyboards with the Chameleons also joind Mark and Andy Whittikar to form Sun and the Moon. Both Andys also played with Manchester Band B.F.G. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chameleons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
