Throughout the late 1980s and 90s, Soundgarden experienced major success as one of the major grunge bands (along with groups such as Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam).\n\nIn 1990, Chris Cornell worked together with the (then) Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, and Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament and Mike McCready (who would later form Pearl Jam) in a project named Temple of the Dog. They wrote a 10 song album as a tribute to Andrew Wood, the singer of Mother Love Bone who had died the year before of a heroin overdose.\n\nIn 1997 Soundgarden split at the zenith of their popularity due to tensions in the group and Chris began a solo career. He released the sucessful album Euphoria Morning. Out of this album came the single Can't Change Me.\n\nWhen Zack De La Rocha left Rage Against The Machine in 2001, Chris Cornell joined the instrumentalists of Rage Against the Machine to form the band Audioslave.\n\nIn 2006 Chris recorded a theme song for the  James Bond 007 movie, \"Casino Royale\", titled You Know My Name, which is used as the opening song.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Cornell started recording his second solo album Carry On, with producer Steve Lillywhite. Among some fellow artists who are expected to accompany him on his second solo release is friend and legendary musician Gary Lucas, who has contributed acoustic guitar to some of the tracks. Cornell has stated that he is always writing, and that there are some songs that he was not able to put into an Audioslave album. Carry On was released in the summer of 2007.\n\nOn February 15, 2007, Chris Cornell issued a statement that he was leaving Audioslave, shortly after Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk reunited with their former vocalist Zack de la Rocha to reform Rage Against the Machine.\n\nChris Cornell released his third solo album, Scream, with American rapper and record producer Timbaland on February 3rd, 2009. This album was a critical failure, and sold poorly. It is rumored that he is going to try and \"De-Timbalandize\" the tracks. \n\nOn January 1st, 2010, Chris Cornell announced the reunion of Soundgarden after a 12 year hiatus.\n\nChris Cornell is extremely revered among the music listeners for his powerful multi-octave singing and gritty, soulful vocal style. He is a baritone with an ability to sing extremely high in the tenor range, as well as in the lower register of a baritone voice. He showcases this in various songs, most notably the studio and the demo versions of \"Beyond the Wheel\", where he can be heard spanning three octaves. He has also experimented with various different vocal styles, ranging from light falsetto to brutal screams and chants. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Cornell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
