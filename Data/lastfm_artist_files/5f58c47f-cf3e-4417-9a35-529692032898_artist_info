These productions were made by playing physically modified vinyl records on highly customized turntables with an additional tone arm.\n\nBrinkmann later founded the Ernst record label and introduced his own productions on a series of 12\" records taking their titles from female names. He has since expanded his extensive production catalog on his own Max Ernst label, as well as other highly respected outfits such as Traum Schallplatten, Raster-Noton and Mute Records (under the Soul Center alias). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Thomas+Brinkmann\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
