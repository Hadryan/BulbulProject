He has performed for years under his given name and also as one half of the electroacoustic duo Opitope, along with Tomoyoshi Date. Hatakeyama got involved in playing music through strumming a guitar in a few rock-oriented bands in his teenage years. Subsequently a laptop computer superseded his bands as his main platform. Hatakeyama polychromes memory-evoking soundscapes with various recorded materials of acoustic instruments such as guitars, vibraphone, and piano; mostly played by hand and processed via laptop. His first album Minima Moralia was commissioned for release by the Chicago-based label kranky in early 2006.\n\nOpitope actively organizes a continuous live performance event named Kuala Mute Geek in Tokyo (Kuala means \"a crossing point of streams\" in Malay). The event is powered by hand-made vacuum tube amplifiers and speakers in up to eight channel settings. Electroacoustic and improvisational artists such as Taylor Duepree, Christopher Willits, Toshimaru Nakamura, Christophe Charles, Hans Reichel, Uchihashi Kazuhisa, Tamaru, Carl Stone, Keiichi Sugimoto, Tetsuro Yasunaga, Boris D Hegenbart, Yoshio Machida and many more have performed. Kuala Mute Geek creates possibilities for interaction and dialogue among the artists and listeners.\n\nHatakeyama collaborated with Tomoyoshi Date on a track on the compilation Small Melodies from Spekk in 2005. He also organizes the improvisation band Copa del Papa with a rotating lineup. Hatakeyama and Date launched a label Kualauk Table to release compilations of their selected sessions with guest artists like Christophe Charles, Tamaru, Tagomago, Asuna, Askococo and others in late 2005.\n\nsource: http://www.kranky.net/artists/hatakeyamac.html <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chihei+Hatakeyama\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
