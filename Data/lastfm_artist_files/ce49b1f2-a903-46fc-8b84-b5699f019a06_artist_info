She also released the album Parthenon under the name Plvs Vltra. Parthenon is her first solo album which features collaborations with Danny Ray Thompson of the Sun Ra Arkestra, Scott Allen of Thunderbirds Are Now!, Thomas Keville of Man Man, and John Schmersal, also of Enon, who produced the album.\n\nOfficial Website: www.enon.tv\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Enon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
