The Belgian dj/producer, currently holding residence in Amsterdam, has issued a firm statement with a range of over 25 relaxed compilations, all of them oozing with excellence and diversity. \nHis Lounge Deluxe series (1999) becomes a classic and are at the basis for the acclaimed label Cinq Etoiles. Under this flag he creates a string of releases ranging from Latin Deluxe down to Welcome to Club Jazz and develops several concepts for clubs such as the infamous Amsterdam lounge NL, beach house Republiek and special products for the likes of Dutch designer Jan Des Bouvrie, vj-icon Micha Klein and the Amsterdam Fashion Week. As a dj, activities spread from regular club gigs to the more highbrow and sophisticated private parties. He starts up his own studio and production company and releases his tracks on a diversity of compilations. In 2003 Monte La Rue joins United Recordings and introduces the label Disque Deluxe. A new series called Deluxe sees the light of day and continues the quest for the ultimate down tempo jewels. A catalogue with releases like 'Blossom' and 'New Wave Disco' is steadily building up. \nApart from compilation duties and numerous dj-gigs, he also creates a tailor-made musical decor for various brands and B2B events. He is a regular contributor and reviewer for the DJ Broadcast site and Jazz magazine and hosted his radio show Deluxe for many years. Beginning 2006, Monte La Rue has started working on his second album. Other new projects include the internet Radio Royale and planning some new and exciting releases for his label. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Monte+La+Rue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
