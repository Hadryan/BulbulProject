Back then they were listening to a distinct and a much harder genre. When they decided to found TNK Caner was 16 and Ali was 18. Later Caner’s another classmate Basri has joined the band as the bass player, the last but far from the least, was the entry of Hasan; the genius guitarist. After the squad was set, they started to make music and having an unbelievable joy out of it.\n\nAfter being awarded the “Most Promising Band” in the year 2002 at the “Sing Your Song” song contest organized by a national TV channel, they went on to win the first prize at the nationwide “Fanta Young Talent Search” contest, refereed by a jury consisting of famous musicians and producers including (Melih Kibar (Musician), Candan Ercetin (Singer), Levent Y..ksel (Musician), Meltem Taskiran (Musican and Chair of MSM Music School, Department of Popular Music), Afsin Akin (Aura Records), Asli Atasoy (Ada Records). \n\n“Sira Bizde” (It’s Our Time) was their first EP and was published in 2005 under the On-Air label. Drummer of the band had to fly off to United states that made way to Arda Aksu who, having replaced Ali Surel, performed well beyond what was expected of him at his age. And now, after signing Onur Ertem, “the best” as some call him, the band has formed into its current final composition.\n\n2009 yılında grup Pasaj Müzik ile anlaşmış ve yaklaşık 11 ay süren yeni albümün kayıt süreci başlamıştır. Kayıtları Ankara’da tamamlanan Volkan Yırtıcı’nın prodüktörlüğünü yaptığı SÖYLE RUHUM albümünde EP’deki tarzdan biraz daha farklı olarak daha enerjik ama aynı zamanda daha karamsar bir müzik ortaya çıkmıştır. Ayrıca albümün mastering aşaması Avustralya’da “Turtle Rock” stüdyolarında Rick O’Neil tarafından tamamlanmıştır.\n\nIn 2009, the band made a contract with Pasaj Music and gave a start to the recording process which is going to take 11 months. The recordings of the LP, named \"Söyle Ruhum\" (Tell Me My Soul), is completed in Ankara with Volkan Yırtıcı as the producer. It's mastering was made in \"Turtle Rock\" studios, Australia. LP's sound was different from the EP with more energetic but with a dejected music style.\n\nThis 10 tracked LP named “Söyle Ruhum” is available since 21st April 2010. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/TNK\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
