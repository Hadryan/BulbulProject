The band is comprised of Justin Warfield (vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Adam Bravin (bass, keyboards). Accompaniment members Thomas Froggatt (guitar) and Scott Ellis (drums) join them on stage. The band have released three albums: \"She Wants Revenge\" (2006), \"This is Forever\" (2007) and \"Valleyheart\" (2011)\n\nShe Wants Revenge's music is hard to emcompass into a single genre or sound. It draws inspiration from several alternative rock and new wave artists. The band blends their influences with ever-present electronics (eg. synths and drum machines) in a style most accurately labeled under the umbrella term, \"darkwave\", a style of music reminiscent of the New Wave and Gothic Rock sounds of the 1980s.\n\nShe Wants Revenge have stated that they make \"dance music\" on numerous occasions setting them aside from the contemporary rock bands often falsely linked with the band in the music press.\n\nHistory\n\nTheir self-titled debut, was released in 2006. They contributed a cover of 'Kindnap the Sandy Claws' to the soundtrack of the \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" re-release. Their next LP release, 'This Is Forever' was released in 2007. They also were featured on a track 'Time', with Timbaland.\n\nOn Feb. 27th, 2008, She Wants Revenge parted ways with Geffen/Interscope to run their own record label called Perfect Kiss Records, from which they released an EP titled 'Save Your Soul'. A second EP followed in 2009, titled \"Up and Down\", which was released on the 22nd of September.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/She+Wants+Revenge\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
