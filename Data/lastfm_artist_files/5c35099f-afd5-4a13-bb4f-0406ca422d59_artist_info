The name of the band is actually the name of the first song they ever wrote, and is made from the words ambient and pop, which they thought was the definition of the music they were making at that time.\n\nThe band was originally a duo, but before making their third album they added a drummer to the band. The band currently consists of 3 members:\n\nBiggi Hilmars: Guitar, Vocals \nKjartan: Keyboards \nJón Geir: Drums \nThose in the know will have first come across the band through their two critically acclaimed electronic based albums released in their homeland. The second of these (“Made for Market”) was considered by many local critics the best Icelandic album of 2003. Their one supporter outside Iceland was John Peel.\n\nKeen to develop their sound the band bunkered down in their own studio and over time developed a more organic and song based direction moving away from the more electronic influences of their earlier material. The first examples of the band’s new direction were demo versions of two songs, “My Delusions” and “Don’t let me down” which saw the light of day early in 2005. These tracks were instantly picked up on by Radio 1’s; Zane Lowe who played “My delusions” on several occasions and invited the band to play live on his show from Austin, Texas, during this year’s SXSW music festival. AMPOP played alongside The Bravery, Hot Hot Heat, The Blood Arm and Queens of the Stone Age as the only unsigned band.\n\nOther important DJs such as Huw Stephens and Vic Galloway at Radio 1, or Vic McGlynn at BBC 6 Music have also put the stamp of approval to the new songs and have championed the band in their radio shows.\n\nAfter the successful appearance at SXSW the band went back to their studio to finish the album, stopping only to play in NY and the NXNE festival in Toronto. The first single off the new album, “My delusions”, gets a UK release via Relentless Records imprint Stimulus Records , who spotted the band live in Austin, on November the 28th.\n\nThe band has been invited to support KT Tunstall in Aberdeen on October the 4 th at a Radio 2 event, and will be playing London next to launch the single on November the 28 th at Islington Bar Academy.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Iceland, the brand new album, “My delusions”, is now out via Dennis Records/Sena and is getting rave reviews and extensive radio play.\n\nStudio albums\nSail to the moon (2006) \nMy Delusions (2005) \nMade For Market (2002) \nNature Is Not A Virgin (2000) \n\nSingles\nGets me Down (2006) \nMy Delusions / Youth (2005) \nMade For Market (2002) \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ampop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
