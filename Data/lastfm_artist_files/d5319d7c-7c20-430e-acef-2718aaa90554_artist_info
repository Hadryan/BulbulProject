A British post-grunge band\n2. A Canadian rock band\n\n1. Bush is an English alternative rock band formed in 1992. The group chose the name \"Bush\" because they used to live in Shepherd's Bush, London.\n\nTheir first album, Sixteen Stone (1994), was a huge commercial success. Almost overnight, Bush went from playing small pubs in London to headlining arenas in the US, the result of extensive promotion on MTV and non-stop touring. Critics labeled them as an inferior derivative of bands such as Nirvana and Pixies, and this criticism followed them throughout their career as a band. In particular, Rossdale's throaty singing voice and random, stream of consciousness-style lyrics were dismissed by some as an imitation of Nirvana's lead singer, Kurt Cobain. Although the band reached superstar status in the U.S., they failed to have much impact on the Britpop riddled UK charts, the lone exception being their single Swallowed, which reached #7. A change in record labels, management and an extended hiatus did not bode well for the band, who unofficially split in 2002.\n\nOn June 21, 2010 it was announced that Bush were reuniting. There will be a new album called \"The Sea of Memories\" (previously named as \"Everything Always Now\"). Two original members, Rossdale and Goodridge, are joined by Chris Traynor and Corey Britz.  The release will be their first indie release since Sixteen Stone, released on Rossdale's own Zuma Rock Records. \n\nBush's albums include Razorblade Suitcase (produced by Steve Albini), Deconstructed, The Science of Things, and Golden State.\n\nFrustrated by the disappointing sales of Golden State (their fifth album, in 2001) and lack of support the band was receiving from Atlantic, the band decided to go on a hiatus. Band members went to work on various other musical projects notably Gavin Rossdale, and his new band Institute.\n\nIn 2005, Bush released The Best of '94 - '99, a greatest hits compilation, and Zen X Four, a CD and DVD which features the band's music videos. Zen X Four was released on Kirtland Records and has its own website.\n\nBush will release their fifth studio album, The Sea Of Memories, on September 13, 2011. It is the band's first studio set in ten years, the first Bush album released on E1 Records and their first venture away from Interscope, who handled all of their previous releases. (Sound Of Winter Songfacts).\n\nBush's members have included Gavin Rossdale, Dave Parsons, Robin Goodridge, Sacha Putnam,  Nigel Pulsford, and Chris Traynor who played lead guitar during the Golden State tour.\n\nThe track The People That We Love was featured in the game Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.\n\nThere was also a Canadian band from Toronto named Bush.  Drummer Whitey Glan, who had also played for Alice Cooper, penned the song \"I Can Hear You Calling\" which was later a hit for Three Dog Night.  Their only album was released in early 70s and was called Bush.\n\nIn Canada, Rossdale's band was once known as Bush^X, because the 1970s band Bush, led by Domenic Troiano, owned the Canadian rights to the name. In April 1997, it was announced that Troiano had agreed to let them use the name Bush in Canada without the exponent X, in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the Starlight Foundation and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund.\n\n2. Bush was a 70s Canadian Rock band signed to RCA in Canada and Dunhill Records in the USA. The members were previously in Mandala and toured with Three Dog Night and Steppenwolf. The Canadian Bush forced the British Bush were forced to release their albums in Canada as Bush X. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
