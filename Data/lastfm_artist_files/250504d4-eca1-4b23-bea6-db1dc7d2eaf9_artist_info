Her song \"Kissing You\" featured on the  1996 Baz Luhrman movie \"Romeo + Juliet\" and is generally considered to be one of her greatest works and a showcase for her distinctive and impressive vocals.\n\nIn 1999, she won a Brit Award for the British Female Solo Artist category. Her 2003 release Dream Soldier was considerably less successful.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Des%27ree\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
