Loop's sound was characterized by strong krautrock and avant-garde influences in addition to the minimalist mayhem of The Stooges and MC5. \n\nTheir songs were almost uniformly harsh and repetitive, with indecipherable vocals buried under layers of noisy guitar riffs and metronomic drumming. Some of the records featured covers of Suicide, The Pop Group and Can as bonus tracks.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1991, the band released three LPs, several singles, appeared on numerous compilations, and a John Peel session, \"Wolf Flow.\"  They are and were often compared to fellow drone-rockers Spacemen 3, and in many ways were overshadowed by them.  Sonic Boom even supposedly accused Loop of stealing their sound from his band, although this claim was contested both by Loop and the UK music press.\n\nAfter the band split, Hampson joined Godflesh briefly, playing on their album \"Pure\", and simultaineously formed Main with Dawson. Wills and MacKay went on to form The Hair and Skin Trading Company. John Wills is now recording under the name of Pumajaw with Pinkie Maclure whom he'd previously worked with under the name Lumen.  MacKay has released work as Juicy Eureka and under his own name.[edit]\n\nMembers\n\nInitial line-up:\n\n    * Robert Hampson (vocals, guitars)\n    * Bex (drums)\n    * Glen Ray (bass)\n\nFinal line-up:\n\n    * Robert Hampson (vocals, guitars)\n    * Scott Dawson (guitar)\n    * John Wills (drums)\n    * Neil MacKay (bass)\n\n\nExternal links\n\n    * http://www.heavensend.org/index.html - general information, discography, images\n    * Robert Hampson official site\n* Pumajaw\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(band)\n\n\n\n2) loOp is a trio from Marseille, France composed of a drummer/pianist, a bassist, and a DJ.  They perform beat-driven electronica with international influences.  Their first full-length album, Superflux, was released in 2005.\n\nhttp://www.loopsound.org/ - lo0p's band website\n\n3) Loop is an Iligan-based band comprising of 4 sexy ladies namely Kim, Micmic, Jc and Jp. The band started in early June when their vocalist (Kim) came back home from a 5-month stay in a far-away place, long enough to realize she needed to be back in the music scene. When she decided to form a band, the three other sexy girls were who she had in mind to be working with. \n\nThe frontlady\nKim has diverse influences in music. From quiet to loud, her list of favorites cling on, balancing both types. However, Kim has managed to create more on the softer side of it. \n\nThe Riffs\nLoop's guitarman, Micmic. Sometimes labeled as the sound technician, the ear, the master. In times when he doesn't pick up the guitar, he tinkers a lot with computers and audio editing software or God knows what else he can do. As Kim creates a softy, Micmic is the mastermind for the crunch of songs to balance it all. After all, he is a Libra. \n\nThe Bass\nMachoman Jp is slapper in his former band, Drunkenstein. He usually revolves around the feel of funkrock and the likes. What others don't know is he's a fan of Jack Johnson and he writes songs of both genre. He has a pizzaplace in his home and everyone who gets to see him around asks for pizza from him.\n\nThe Sidestick\nJc has been doing solid hits ever since the Defnet era (2006?). But really, aside from finding it easy to play with the metronome and speed, he contributes a lot of guitar riffs too for the band!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/loop.iligan <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Loop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
