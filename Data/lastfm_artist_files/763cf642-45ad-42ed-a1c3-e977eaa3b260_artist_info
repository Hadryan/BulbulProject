He released his self-titled debut LP in 2008 and has since gained notable media attention from the internet, and other areas including Pitchfork  and ABC News. After gaining recognition, Ryan Ulsh was enlisted as a touring drummer and Wavves embarked on their first US and European tours. Originally signed to Fat Possum Records, he released his second full-length album Wavvves with them in 2009 and his third album, King of the Beach, on August 3rd 2010. \n\nKing of the Beach features a complete rhythm section comprised of Stephen Pope and Billy Hayes, both formerly of the late Jay Reatard's touring band. They toured for almost a year straight until Hayes left the band for some time off. Jacob Cooper, former drummer of The Mae Shi, has since taken his place. After playing the major festival circuit, Nathan started his own record label Ghost Ramp and released the Life Sux EP on September 20th 2011.\n\nOn March 26, 2013 Wavves released their 4th studio album \"Afraid of Heights\" on Mom + Pop records. Jacob Cooper left the band in 2013. Brian Hill (The Soft Pack/The Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower) began playing drums soon after.\n\nWavves' fifth album entitled \"V\" was released on October 2, 2015 through Ghost Ramp and Warner Bros. Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wavves\">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."}}}
