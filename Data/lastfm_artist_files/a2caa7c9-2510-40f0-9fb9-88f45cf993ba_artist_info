Windscreen wipers of washed sound.\n\nReleasing his first single in 2002, by March 2005, he released his first solo album, Incommunicado, on the Soma Records label to critical acclaim, after taking him 4 years to put together. His evocative style was well suited to creating heightened emotional moods which spanned minimal techno, grime and electronica. He even performs the vocals on political track \"Don't See the Point\".\n\nIncommunicado was followed by Paradolia in April 2006. Filled with mournful melodies, meandering sound effects and the occasional sombre vocal, Smoke is in top form production wise. His rapid rise amongst the techno ranks has led to him being in high demand across Europe. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Smoke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
