In 1990 she returned to Rio and her recording career took off. \n\nHer most popular album is the live recording Acústico (\"Acoustic\") that she did for MTV Brasil. Her best-known hit songs are her cover of \"Malandragem\", originally written by Cazuza, and \"Segundo Sol\". Eller is known for her fusion of MPB with rock as well as for her deep husky singing voice. \n\nShe is also notable as one of Brazil's most prominent lesbian artists. Her sexuality, along with her musical style, has caused some to draw comparisons with Ani DiFranco, the Indigo Girls as well as Melissa Etheridge.\n\nEller died on December 29, 2001 after being rushed to hospital in Rio de Janeiro by her partner. She was admitted in a delirious and incoherent state during which she suffered a series of heart attacks; a police investigation concluded that these were due to a heart condition rather than to drug use. She was 39 years old. She left a young son behind whose custody was assumed by her partner.\n\nEller still has a devoted following in Brazil, and her popularity has continued to grow. Her music continues to be played daily on various Brazilian radio stations and her CDs are still prominently for sale in stores. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/C%C3%A1ssia+Eller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
