With a stylistic origin based in the genre of electronica, his songs usually range between downtempo, ambient and pop, also bearing strong influences from world music and Central Asian culture. It can also be observed to seek a fusion between the contrast of organic and electronic sounds, sometimes leaning more towards one direction than the other.\n\nSince the release of the eponymous debut album Conjure One in 2002, Conjure One has produced three albums to date, including Extraordinary Ways in 2005 and Exilarch in 2010, all published through Nettwerk. The albums see Fulber collaborate with various guest vocalists, including Chemda, Poe, Sinéad O'Connor, and Jaren, while the latter two records have also featured backup vocals and bass performances by Leah Randi.\n\nConjure One's work has also been featured in commercial media, with the single Tears from the Moon feat. Sinéad O'Connor making an appearance on the film soundtrack Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. In addition, the single Center of the Sun has also made a vague appearance in the film X2: X-Men United, where it plays in the background of the scene with Collosus and Flea drawing and making fun of Rogue and Bobby, who are about to kiss.\n\nSee Facebook and Twitter for the latest Conjure One news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/conjureone\nhttp://twitter.com/conjure_one\n\nOfficial Conjure One sites and resources:\nhttp://www.conjureone.com\nhttp://soundcloud.com/conjureone\nhttp://gigsby.com/conjure-one\nhttp://www.myspace.com/conjureone\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/conjureonevideo\nhttp://www.nettwerk.com/producer/rhys-fulber <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Conjure+One\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
