The band began in 1997 composed of six members, since 2001 it has consisted of Ola Klüft (vocals, guitar), Martin Gustafson (keyboards, backing vocals), Pehr Åström (bass), and Thomas Hedlund (drums).\n\nAlthough they have not had a major commercial breakthrough yet, they do have a fanbase that stretches across Europe and North America. They've had several songs appear in episodes of some popular American television programs: Grey's Anatomy, The OC, Veronica Mars, One Tree Hill, 16 and Pregnant, and Greek. Their song Sway also plays on the \"College rock\" station in the Sims 2. Also of note is the fact that Sarah Isaksson (Klüft's former vocal teacher) is a featured artist on their song Pills.\n\nSince 2011, Ola Klüft has been performing solo under the name A Lanky Swede. Thomas Hedlund has been seen playing drums for Phoenix during their North American Tour.\n\n2) The other group is British and has released two albums (as of 2007). The band is a four-piece originally from Basingstoke but now based in London. The Perishers are: Paul Osbourne (vocals, bass), Torquil Pagdin (guitar), Spencer Chisholm (guitar) and Diff (drums).  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Perishers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
