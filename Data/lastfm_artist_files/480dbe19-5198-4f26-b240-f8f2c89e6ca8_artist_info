(“there is no band”, Mulholland Dr. 2001) pretty much sums up where 40 Winks aims to go with its instrumental hip hop: meticulously chop and paste samples together, to create an atmosphere of beats and vibes which steps beyond unimaginative loops. \nTheir emphasis on creating vintage organically sounding beats has left people wondering why 40 Winks won’t perform live, the answer simply being: ”there is no band!”.\n\n40 Winks hit the scene in 2002, with a whole slew of laidback beats. Eager to share their sound with the world, they released a couple of albums independently. The attention they got from this, allowed them to build with people from around the world.\nOne of these independently released albums, More Than Loops, got reissued in Japan on Swamp Records, after that the ball kept rolling.\n\nOn their first worldwide release, Extended Pleasure on Escapism Records (2005), they reached listeners well beyond the (instrumental) hip hop community with the song “melancholia”. After appearances on compilations, like Weapons of Hope on Little-D (2006), they got a chance to do their thing on the renowned label, Merck Records with Sound Puzzle (2007). \nAll these exotic international adventures, led them back to Europe, where the German based Project: Mooncircle welcomed them with a spot on the compilation Heart on the right spot (2007) and a full album The Lucid Effect (2008). In 2009 they took some time off, doing solo stuff and remixes. \n\nIn 2011 40 Winks is back with a double LP called It’s The Trip (2011) on Project: Mooncircle.\n\n\nDiscography\n•2011: It's the trip (album 2LP - Project: Mooncircle)\n•2010: The moon comes closer (album 2LP/digital - Project: Mooncircle)\n•2009: In the first place, does digital harinezumi dream? (album CD - Powershovel AUDIO)\n•2009: Silent in truth (album CD/2LP - Project: Mooncircle)\n•2008: The Lucid Effect (album CD/LP - Project: Mooncircle)\n•2007: Heart on the right spot (compilation, 2LP/CD – Project: Mooncircle)\n•2007: Sound Puzzle (album, CD/12” – Merck Records)\n•2006: Weapons of Hope (compilation, 12” – Little-D)\n•2005: Extended Pleasure (EP, 12” – Escapism Records)\n•2005: If Luck Would Have It… (compilation, CD – Little-D)\n•2005: More Than Loops // Japan (album, CD – Swamp Records)\n•2004: Hypu – Listen to the Hype (compilation, CD – Hypu Japan)\n•2003: More Than Loops (album, CD)\n•2002: Hit the Hay (album, cassette)\n•2002: April to July (demo, cd)\n\n\n40 Winks: Homepage | Facebook | MySpace | Soundcloud | Mixcloud | Vimeo | YouTube | Bandcamp <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/40+Winks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
