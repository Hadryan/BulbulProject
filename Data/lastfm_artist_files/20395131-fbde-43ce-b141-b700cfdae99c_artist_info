It included 'Cocoa Hooves', 'Golden Antlers' and 'Exxus', later included on the 'Black Mambo / Exxus EP'.\n\nHaving left the confines of their creative hub in the woodlands of Oxfordshire (referred to as The Shed), the band took up residence at Paul Epworth’s London studio in the Autumn of 2013. 'Psylla' was released on November 11 by Wolf Tone (Epworth's own label) backed with 'Woozy (feat. Jean Deaux)'.\n\nThe track 'Gooey' was premièred on February 13, as the second taster to their forthcoming début album, \"ZABA\". Released on June 9th 2014, the 11 track record was recorded at Wolf Tone Studios in London, and produced by frontman Dave Bayley under executive production of Paul Epworth. 'Pools' was announced as the follow up single on April 16.\n\nhttp://glass-animals.tumblr.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Glass+Animals\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
