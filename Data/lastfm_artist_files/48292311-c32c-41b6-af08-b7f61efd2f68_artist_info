He began playing the guitar and harmonica at age 16 after he was immoblised from a chronic illness. He was very sick back then, and as a result of that, he had to be in bed 24/7. To please himself he started singing. This is when he discovered his inspiration: Stevie Wonder. \n\nWhen he got better, he was struggling to gain fame. He performed in bars, restaurants and as opening act for artists like Cher, Seal and Jonathan Cerrada.\n\nDuring the opening act for Jonathan Cerrada Cristophe got noticed by Dove Attia, who asked him if he would do a casting for the musical Le Roi soleil. He got the part.\n\nFrance’s most pupular radio station named Christophe “revolution of the year”, and in March 07 he released his first soloalbum (mon paradis). Over 1 million copies were sold. \n\nHis musical influences are Bob Marley, Ben Harper, Tracy Chapman, and Jack Johnson.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Christophe+Ma%C3%A9\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
