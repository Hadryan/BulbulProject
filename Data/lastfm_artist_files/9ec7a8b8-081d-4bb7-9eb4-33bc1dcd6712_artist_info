Franov collaborated with Juana Molina on three of her albums, \"Segundo\" (2000), \"Tres Cosas\" (2002) and \"Son\" (2006). With \"Khali\" Staubgold is proud to present his first worldwide release, after five solo albums which have only been released in South America and Japan.\n\n\"Khali\" which is mainly based on three instruments - the African mbira, the Paraguayan harp arpa and the Indian sitar - is the result of Franov's studies in African and Arabic music, especially the music of the Shona from Zimwbabwe. He carefully combines these unique instruments with percussion, voices and minimal electronics in order to create a comfortably floating stream of world music in the purest sense, hardly relating to any certain country or region.\n\nOn the one hand \"Khali\" is the name of the Croatian island where Franov's grandfather was born, on the other hand it's taken from the tabla rhythm cycle of Hindustani music, and it's the name of a Hindu goddess.\n\nBorn in 1972, today Alejandro Franov is one of the most important musicians in Argentina. His unique musical talent has attracted many artists and led to collaborations with Juana Molina, Liliana Herrero,\nFernando Kabusacki, Mono Fontana, Santiago Vasquez, Seiichi Yamamoto (Rovo, ex-Boredoms), Yuji Katsui (Rovo), Kama Aina and many more. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alejandro+Franov\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
