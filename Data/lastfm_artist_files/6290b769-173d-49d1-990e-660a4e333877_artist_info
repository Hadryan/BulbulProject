With all the members being Liverpudlian, this led to comparisions with The Coral, especially as both bands were signed to the same record label - Deltasonic - and had the same producer - Ian Broudie. Their debut album - Who Killed The Zutons? - was released on October 18th 2004, and reached number 9 in the UK album chart.\n\nLine up\n\nDavid McCabe on lead vocals and guitar Abi Harding on saxophone and vocals\nSean Payne on drums, percussion and vocals \nRussell Pritchard on bass guitar and vocals\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Zutons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
