Original line-up recorded the EP \"Spooky Action at a Distance\" (2002) and album \"Decoder Ring\" (2002). Geoff Towner departed in 2003 and was replaced by Ben Ely (Regurgitator).\n\nThe track \"Night Shift\" from the EP \"Spooky Action at a Distance\" featuring vocals by Jodi Phillis (Clouds) was utilised in the soundtrack to the Alex Proyas film \"Garage Days\" (2002).\n\nThe band wrote the soundtrack for the 2004 Australian film Somersault, for which the band won an AFI Award for 'Best Original Music Score', an Australian Screen Sound Guild Award for 'Soundtrack of the Year', a Lexus IF (Inside Film) Award for 'Best Music', 'Best Original Song Composed for a Feature Film, Telemovie, TV Series or Mini-Series' at the APRA/Australian Screen Music Awards, a Jackson Hole Film Festival Award for 'Best Score' and was nominated for an ARIA Award in the category of 'Best Soundtrack/Cast/Show Recording'.\n\nKenny Davis Jr & Ben Ely departed after the recording of Somersault in 2004, the band subsequently reconfiguring with new members Lenka Kripac (vocals, keyboards), Xavier Fijac (keyboards, samples) & Matthew Steffen (bass).\n\nAll the band's performances are accompanied by film projections put on by Simon Killalea who, while not playing an instrument, is considered a member of the band.\n\nThe band wrote the soundtrack for the 2005 short feature Jewboy by writer/director Tony Krawitz, which was presented in 2006 at the Sundance Film Festival.  Both of the films were shown at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2005 saw the band performing at the Homebake Festival, the Big Day Out concerts, Splendour in the Grass and Coockatoo Island Festival and the Perth International Arts Festival.\n\nIn 2006 Decoder Ring performed at the St Jeromeâ€™s Laneway Festival (Sydney) in March, then at Los Angeles, the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas shows in New York, followed by The Great Escape Festival, Splendour in the Grass and a national tour of Australia.\n\nIn 2007 a short film by Stephen Lance, Yolk, with music by Decoder Ring was screened as part of the Sydney Film Festival.\n\nRecently Decoder Ring's remix of the song \"Yama Yama\" featured on an Australian Television advertisement for Tooheys Extra Dry beer. The song is adapted from Le Monde Fabuleux Des Yamasuki, a pseudo-Japanese concept album produced by French duo Jean Kluger and Daniel Vangarde (also known as The Yamasuki Singers) in 1972. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Decoder+Ring\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
