The group gained prominence primarily as a result of BBC Radio, initially through BBC Introducing Lancashire before receiving BBC Radio 1 airtime from the a range of DJs including Nick Grimshaw and Annie Mac. Bondax's sound has often been described as difficult to describe and transcending genres, as Moses Wiener of Dazed and Confused details the band's sound as \"the aural equivalent of sipping an ice-cold Pimms on the balcony of your council estate flat.\".\n\nBoth Adam and George studied at QES (Queen Elizabeth School) Kirkby Lonsdale.\n\nIn 2012, Bondax started their own record label, Just Us Recordings. The first release on the label was a track by fellow producer Karma Kid entitled It's Always.\n\nIn 2013, the duo performed at a number of festivals across Europe including; Bestival,Creamfields , and Beacons\n\nBondaxâ€™s evocative music seems to drift between urban sonic landscapes, avoiding classification. Incorporating elements of post-dubstep, R&B, and garage, the Lancaster based duo craft an intimate, electronic bliss that reveals something new with each repeated play. Despite the fact that Adam and George are still enjoying their teens, their music shimmers with a maturity and sophistication that belies their age. 2011 Lancaster, Lancashire, England <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bondax\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
