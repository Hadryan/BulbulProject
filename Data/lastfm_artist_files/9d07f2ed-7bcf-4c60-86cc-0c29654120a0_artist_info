Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool and Fair to Midland, RISHLOO strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree and more.\n\nIn February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of RISHLOO. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as RISHLOO. \n\nContinuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, RISHLOO have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation and Last.FM.\n\nWith a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, RISHLOO continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada.  In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata and Judas Priest.\n\nThe band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released January 2015. \n\nPast Member(s) :\nTyler (Drums)\n\nwww.rishloo.com\nwww.facebook.com/Rishloo\nwww.myspace.com/rishlooband\nwww.twitter.com/rishlooband\nwww.reverbnation.com/rishloo\nwww.youtube.com/rishloomusic <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rishloo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
