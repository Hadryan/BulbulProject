They were originally formed by Edwyn Collins as the Nu-Sonics in 1976 which became Orange Juice in 1979. The group is perhaps best known for the hit \"Rip it Up\", which reached #8 on the UK singles charts in February 1983, the band's only UK top 40 single.\n\nThe band's first official show was on April 20th, 1979 at the Victoria Cafe at the Glasgow School of Art. The band released their first singles on Postcard Records records, before signing to Polydor for their first album \"You Can't Hide Your Love Forever\". However, internal tensions led to this first version of the band breaking up, and for their subsequent albums.\n\nMusically the band attempted to fuse post-punk guitars with disco and funk rhythms, rather in the manner of the Gang of Four. (Other key influences included Buzzcocks and Subway Sect). Lyrically, however, Orange Juice were always far more commercially minded than the Leeds-based Marxists: Edwyn Collins in particular adopting a fey, camp vocal style. In general, band were known for their love of kitsch, irony, and literate optimism.\n\nBy early 1984, Ross and McClymont had left the band leaving a core line-up of Collins and Manyika. Together the duo recorded Orange Juice's final album, The Orange Juice. They also enlisted several musical friends to help them out on the recording. It was produced by Dennis Bovell.\n\n(2)  A three-piece, jam/rock/reggae band from Naples, Florida that has released two albums titled \"Heart Well Fed\" and \"Tides Keep Changing.\"  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Orange+Juice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
