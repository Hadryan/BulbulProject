It released two full lengths on Trustkill Records plus numerous 7\"s and splits. Members have gone on to bands such as The Hope Conspiracy, Season of Fire, Krakatoa and The Good Fight.\n\n\nHarvest (2)\nHarvest is a band from Barcelona that makes alternative music. Formed in 2008, result of the passion for music that Monique van der Kolk (vocals), Jordi Amela (keyboard) and Jordi Prats (guitar) share. The union of the three and the influence of mostly progressive rock have provided a non conventional and peculiar but soulful sound to Harvest. A few months later, Roger Vilageliu (bass) and Alex Ojea (drums) joined the band to complete the line-up. \n\nTheir 1st studio album is called \"Underground community\", featuring a cover of  Marillion's \"Waiting to happen\" while the artwork is by Antonio Seijas (\"Happiness on the road\" ). \n\nLive concerts are scheduled very often, with special mention to Marillionâ€™s Happiness on the road gig in Barcelona (february 2009) with Harvest as supporting band. \n\nwww.myspace.com/harvestmusic\n\n\nHarvest (3)\nHarvest is also the name of the Christian band founded in Lindale, Texas by Jerry Williams in 1977. The vision of Harvest was to see 100 million people come to know Jesus Christ personally through the band's music ministry.\n\nAlong with Jerry Williams, the original members of Harvest were Ed Kerr and Paul Wilbur - both music students. Wilbur had met Williams at a church where Williams was the youth pastor, and Williams had been influential in Wilbur's decision to become a Christian.\n\nEd Kerr was a mutual friend of both Williams and Wilbur. The three men collaborated on the first two albums created by Harvest: Harvest and Morning Sun.\n\nLater in 1981, Wilbur left Harvest and the group was reformed as a duo of Williams and Kerr. Williams and Kerr were together for the production of many records, including It's Alright Now, Send Us to the World, Voices, Only the Overcomers, Give Them Back, Holy Fire and Carry On. In 1982 the magazine CCM took notice of the duo in its article, \"A Bountiful Harvest.\" The writer praised the group's vocal harmonies and was especially fond of the song \"Because I Am\" (found on the album It's Alright Now.\n\nIn 1988, it was the Discovery Broadcasting Network that took note of the band. The network recorded a live video of Harvest in concert. On the cover of the video, the network stated that Harvest averages \"over 100 concerts a year,\" a large number of performances for any band.\n\nBy 1991, Ed Kerr left the group and Harvest became a five-player band led by Williams. With various members, Williams' band produced Let's Fight (For a Generation), Mighty River, and 41 Will Come. In 1992 the band went on an \"Olympic and European Tour.\" They performed in Spain at the Barcelona Summer Olympics and at the Sevilla World Expo. Their tour also took them into Germany as part of Operation Mobilisation's \"Love Europe\" crusade. Harvest finished its tour with a performance in Holland.\n\n\nHarvest (4)\nHarvest was a band based in Bristol UK in the late '90s/early part of the new millennium. Swirling soundscapes and soaring vocals characterized their inimitable style. The band broke up in 2001 with most of the members going on to folk rock and rockabilly act Babel, which is signed to People Tree records and awaiting the release of their its first album.\n\n\nHarvest (5)\nHarvest is a New Zealand hard rock band. Harvest formed in Rotorua in early 2004 playing a range of Metal based music. The band began gigging in December that year and by 2005 had placed third in the Rotorua regional Rock Quest finals. In 2006 Hugh White took over vocals and Harvest began to take their music in a more Metal/Hard Rock direction influenced by the likes of Pantera, Avenged Sevenfold and Alice in Chains.\n\n\nHarvest (6)\nHarvest is also a metal band formed in Berlin, Germany and was together from 2000 to 2008.  The band included Lenny on vox and guitar, chrille on guitar, flo on drums and matze on bass.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/harvestberlingermany\n\nHarvest (7)\nFormed after the popular Oklahoma City group Phoenix broke up, Harvest leaned more toward hard rock than the soul-based garage of the previous group.  The band featured Pat Smiley, Larry Rogers, John Proctor, Roger Harrison, and Rick Cobble.  They achieved some regional success in the early 1970s.\n\nHarvest (8)\nHarvest was a dark ambient/glitch/noise music project. Harvest was Justin Headrick of ElseProduct / 3z13, and Roger Petro of acitine. 2006 saw the addition of Greg Rapp to the Harvest lineup. Harvest produced music from about 2000 to 2008. The bulk of material generated by Harvest saw little distribution and likely will remain as such.\n\nHarvest (9)\nHarvest is a Japaneses indie band that is a part of Kisaki's ROAD AWAKE sub label.\n\nHarvest (10)\n.. All started with a passion for music at a really young age, picked up the guitar at junior school played it for years. Over that time playing in bands a touring the uk when a singer of an old band left an old global tape in his car and stays in there to this day.\n\nAfter about a year of listening to it in his car and his band a the time splitting Harvest decided to build a studio and with some advice and guidance from a good mate from college dr dub, who had been making tunes when they meet at college, he was then set. After sending a few tunes out to some dj's he was soon getting positive response and feedback and started to learn how to mix tunes on his decks.\n\nNow getting tunes played by the likes of, Logan d, Majistrate, Ruff Stuff, Dj Sly, Pleasure, Dj Escape, CKB, etc... Looks like Harvest will be busy and is very determined. \n\nHarvest (11)\nBlack Metal band from Australia with 2 demos and a split released thus far.\n\nHARVEST (12)\nVocal - Shige, Guitar - Toshiyuki, Bass - Taka, Drums - Bun.\nSince 2004, they sought out to show their own world view with heavy, aggressive music that incorporated elements from traditional Japanese music as well. They have coined their sound: \"ORIENTAL HEAVY ROCK\".  Homepage: http://www.harvest000.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Harvest\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
