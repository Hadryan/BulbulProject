They won Classic Rock Magazine's, Best New Band of 2005 award. \n\nObviously influenced by 70s hard rock artists like Led Zeppelin, Thin Lizzy and Deep Purple and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, singer Cormac Neeson's powerful vocals are reminiscent of Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers or Ronnie James Dio. When playing live they produce a varied set, combining hard rock songs with modernised blues covers.\n\nThe band played at a Phil Lynott memorial benefit gig in Dublin, as Lynott’s mother is a big fan. So big in fact that she allowed bass player Micky Waters to be the first since Lynott’s death to open his case and play the legendary black bass within. It’s the same instrument that appears in the music video for Keep Believin'. \n\nThe Answer have supported bands such as Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, AC/DC and The Who and have been joined on stage by Free and Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers.\n\n\"The Answer, best group since Free.\" ~ Paul Rodgers\n\nThe song \"Never Too Late\" is a playable song in Guitar Hero IV (Video Game).\nCormac Neeson - Vocals\nPaul Mahon - Guitar\nMichael Waters - Bass\nJames Heatley - Drums\n\nLinks:\nOfficial site\nWikipedia\nMyspace\n\nMost recently The Answer have received praise for their support slot on the Ac/Dc tour of Black Ice. Following this tour the band will be performing their own headline tour of their new album Everyday Demons for fans in the U.K and  Ireland. \n\nThe Everyday Demons album has received praise and recognition world wide and is up for Classic Rock Magazine's Album of the Year. The song Demon Eyes from the album on its release became I-tunes  single of the week and was downloaded over 280,000 times in that week.\n\nSo far 2009 has been a year of much success for The Answer and looks certain to continue for many years in which no doubt they will be selling out arenas on their own tours.\n\n(2)\nThe Answer - NWHC\nFast, aggressive straight edge hardcore from Seattle Washington. \n\n(3)\nThe Answer was also a progressive thrash metal band from Dallas, Texas influenced by Watchtower. They released one demo in 1987 and then split up.\n\n(4) The Answer (US garage band 60s)\nFormed   1965,    Berkeley, CA, United States\nDisbanded   1966 //\nMembers   Todd Anderson (vocals), Michael Friedman (bass guitar), Chip Wright (lead guitar), Mike Simpson (rhythm guitar), Bob Shumaker (drums)\nOne 7\" - 1965   Why You Smile / I'll Be In - Appears on Garage Beat '66, Vol. 3: Feeling Zero...\n\nTheir hit single, The Disadvantage Of You, became a jingle for 'Benson & Hedges' cigarettes.\n\nAmongst the bands better known fans is Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page.\n\nNew Album News – So the new album is called ‘Revival’ as you well may know by now. It was produced by the Grammy-nominated Chris ‘Frenchie’ Smith, and was mixed by Chris Sheldon. It will be released in Europe on October 3rd 2011. The initial run of the album will be a limited edition deluxe format with 24-page booklet & band sleeve-notes, plus an 11-track second disc containing previously unreleased studio, acoustic, demo & cover material. The band had a really hard time condensing the songs to one 12 track album so hence the bonus disc of extra material. The full track-listing is as follows:-\n\nWaste Your Tears ~ Use Me ~ Trouble ~ Nowhere Freeway ~ Tornado ~ Vida (I Want You) ~ Caught On The Riverbed ~ Destroy Me ~ New Day Rising  ~ Can’t Remember, Can’t Forget ~ One More Revival  ~ Lights Are\nDown.\n\nThe second CD is called After The Revival and the tracks are as follows:-\n\nPiece By Piece ~ Faith Gone Down ~ Nowhere Freeway (live acoustic) ~ Tailspin ( Renegade Demo ) ~ Fire And Water (cover of the Free classic) ~ What I Am ( Demo ) ~ Caught On The Riverbed (live acoustic) ~ The Enemy (demo) ~ Show Me The World (demo) ~ One More Revival(live acoustic) ~ Lights Are Down ( Piano + Vocal version ).\n\n(5) Hardcore from Lima Peru, with one demo entitled \"Juventud Violenta\" out now on their Bandcamp. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Answer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
