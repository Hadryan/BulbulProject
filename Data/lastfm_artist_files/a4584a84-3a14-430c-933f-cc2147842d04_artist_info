They are best known for their 2009 single \"Dominos\", which peaked at #27 on the UK Singles Chart and #36 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States.\n\nThis London duo use gritty beats, droning guitars, abstract effects and dreamy vocals to create a soundscape that is arty yet tuneful. They have previously supported Muse, TV On The Radio, Florence + The Machine, Crystal Castles and Klaxons.\n\nMilo Cordell is son of 1960s pop producer Denny and runs the Merok label, which has released cutting-edge dance acts Klaxons and Crystal Castles.
