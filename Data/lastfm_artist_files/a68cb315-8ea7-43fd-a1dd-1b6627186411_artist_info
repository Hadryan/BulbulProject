He is best known for writing and supervising music for Marvel Entertainment on titles such as Spider-Man and Incredible Hulk. Leon is a songwriter on the themes to the Marvel series Avengers and Super Hero Squad, and he composed the main title music to the shows Xyber 9 and Mr. Bill Presents. \n\nLeon was featured as a musician on NPR's syndicated program Morning Edition in five episodes between the years 2005 to 2010. He was also featured on the album Rockabye Baby! Baby's Favorite Rock Songs, which was available exclusively at Starbucks March 23-April 19, 2010. The album reached #3 on Billboard’s Kids Albums chart, #18 on the Billboard Independent Albums, and #111 on the Billboard Top 200. It contains a version of the Rolling Stones song Ruby Tuesday that Leon performed and produced for the Rockabye Baby! series, which also features the artists Björk, Journey and Kanye West.\n\nIn 1990, Leon received a B.A. degree from UCLA in music composition, where he focused on piano performance, film scoring and electronic music production. While attending the college, he did internships with Academy Award nominated composers, Mark Isham and Danny Elfman, the latter of which resulted in Leon's first feature film credit on the Clive Barker movie, Nightbreed. Immediately following college, Leon worked on Days of Our Lives, garnering him an Emmy nomination for \"Outstanding Music Director.\"\n\nIn 1994, Leon began working for New World, the parent company of Marvel at that time, as Music Director and composer on the TV series Valley of the Dolls. The following year (1995) was the start of his work for Marvel as composer and music supervisor on the show Spider-Man in addition to other titles for Fox Kids.\n\nLeon subsequently held a Vice President of Music title for Fox from 1997 to 2002. During that time, he supervised music for Fox Family (now ABC Family) as well as Fox Kids. Also during that period as a music VP for Fox, Leon received music supervisor credits on many film and television projects such as the movie \"Les Miserables\" starring John Malkovich and the primetime series \"State of Grace\" for ABC Family starring Frances McDormand. Leon left ABC Family in 2002 and established Sound Mind Music, which is his active company today.\n\nMore recently, Leon performed and arranged songs for a series of albums on Vitamin Records by artists including Neil Young, The Cure, R.E.M. and Pink Floyd. Starting in 2009, Leon has been writing and supervising music for a series of Motion Comics for Marvel, beginning with The Astonishing X-Men by Joss Whedon. In 2011, Leon wrote the music for an iPhone/iPad game for the Chillingo division of Electronic Arts, the publisher of the hugely successful Angry Birds game app. The game is slated to be released in 2011 along with the movie Thor: Tales of Asgard which Leon music supervised and is a co-production between Marvel and Lions Gate Entertainment. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Ari+Leon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
