The band produced their first album \"Shadows Of The Past\" in 1991 with singer/guitarist Miika Tenkula. The next two albums \"North From Here\" and \"Amok\" and the following EP \"Love & Death\" had bassist Taneli Jarva as singer, but in 1995 Taneli decided to take a few years off to rest before starting a new band, The Black League. Sentenced recruited Ville Laihiala in 1996 and put out the album \"Down\". Taneli's deep rumbling voice was replaced by Ville's warm and clear delivery. The dark-maned Finn immediately put his own touch to the new, melancholic and pain-ridden songs.\n\nThe band put out an album almost every 2 years. Following \"Down\" in 1996 came \"Frozen\", \"Crimson\" and \"The Cold White Light\". Sentenced decided to lay the band to rest with the final album \"The Funeral Album\" in 2005, at the peak of their career. It gives a taste of all eras of the career of Sentenced.\n\nThe band's only DVD \"Buried Alive\" came out in November 2006 (in most European countries). The DVD includes the final show in Club Teatria, all videos (including an upcoming video of \"Despair-Ridden Hearts\") and some extra material of all those years.\n\nTheir guitarist Miika Tenkula was found dead in his home on February 18th 2009. He was 34 years old.\n\nVesa Ranta (drummer) said: \"Miika had a serious drinking problem for many years which escalated after Sentenced was buried. They don't call it King Alcohol for nothing...\" An autopsy revealed that he had suffered from a genetic heart condition, and suffered a heart attack at his home on February 18, 2009.\n\n\nDiscography\n\nWhen Death Join Us Demo, 1990  \nChronology of Death Split, 1991  \nRotting Ways to Misery Demo, 1991  \nShadows of the Past Full-length, 1991  \nJourney to Pohjola Demo, 1992  \nNorth From Here Full-length, 1993  \nDemo 1994 Demo, 1994  \nThe Trooper EP, 1994  \nAmok Full-length, 1995  \nLove and Death EP, 1995  \nDown Full-length, 1996  \nStory: A Recollection Best of/Compilation, 1997  \nFrozen Full-length, 1998  \nKilling Me Killing You Single, 1999  \nCrimson Full-length, 2000  \nNo One There Single, 2002  \nThe Cold White Light Full-length, 2002  \nRoutasyd√§n Single, 2003  \npromo split MCD Split, 2005 \nEver-Frost Single, 2005  \nThe Funeral Album Full-length, 2005  \nBuried Alive DVD, 2006  \nBuried Alive Live album, 2006  \nBuried Alive (Box) Boxed set, 2006  \nThe Glow of 1000 Suns / Amok Run EP, 2008  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sentenced\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
