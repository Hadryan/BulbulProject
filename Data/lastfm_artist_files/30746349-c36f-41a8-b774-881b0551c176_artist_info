For the band the name ‘Mozaik’ represented the fusion of rock, western classical influences, jazz and traditional turkish sounds within their music. \nIn 1995 she formed her second group the Ayse Tütüncü Piano Percussion Ensemble (piano – percussions – bass clarinet) and released the album ‘Variations’ in 1999 which took her to international festivals both in Turkey and Europe. \nSince 2004 Ayse has played her new compositions within her Trio, each track having been specifically arranged for “two wind instruments and a piano”. In 2005 the Trio recorded ‘Carnivalesque’ (EMI / Blue Note) and has since performed live at the Prague Jazz Open Festival, Akbank Jazz Festival Istanbul, Rochella Jonica Festival Italy, and the North Sea Jazz Festival. The Ayse Tutuncu Trio will perform for the first time at the London Jazz Festival this year after the success of her new Bluenote album 'Carnivalesque' which is now on sale in European territories including U.K , Germany, Holland, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Italy,Greece, Russia and many more with Japan, Taiwan and India in asian territories.. \n\nwww.myspace.com/aysetutuncu <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ay%C5%9Fe+T%C3%BCt%C3%BCnc%C3%BC\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
