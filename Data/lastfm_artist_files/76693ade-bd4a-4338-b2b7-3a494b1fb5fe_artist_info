The major goal of the band is to prove that folk music has a multi-layered soul and folk music's dynamism is very close to pop music's dynamism. The band members (Aziz Azmet, Cahit Berkay, Taner Ongur, Engin Yorukoglu and Murat Ses) tried to fuse the technical aspects of pop music with the melodies of ancient Anatolian folk music in late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nCahit Berkay, Taner Öngür and Engin Yörükoğlu reformed the band in 1993, and were joined by keyboard player Serhat Ersöz. Murat Ses is dealing with other projects and is still pursuing an extraordinary international career.\n\nThe group won the Grand Prix du Disque (previously won by such groups as Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix) in 1971.\n\nMurat Ses (the group's keyboardist, arranger and composer) work and composition Ağrı Dağı Efsanesi (The Legend of Mount Ararat) was inspired by ancient legends of 'the Flood' in different cultures. In live versions over ten minutes he made use of diverse FX possibilities of his time to tell a sonic story with his keyboards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mo%C4%9Follar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
