She did her studies in her İstanbul quarter of Şehremini and in the Turkish Classical Music Department of Istanbul Technical University.\nHer first album, \"Be Adam\" (O man!) which was released in 1995, gave Gülşen a good debut in Turkey's music world, and her second album, \"Erkeksen\" (If you are a man), came three years afterwards in 1998. Following another interval of three years, the album \"Şimdi\" (Now) was released in 2001. This did not attain the popularity she had hoped. The relative failure of this album could be attributed to the image she presented on her 2004 album \"Of...Of...\". The music video for the main title \"Sarışınım\" (My blonde), in which she was barely covered with blurred spots on a few parts of her slim body, was judged as obscene by the state watchdog for TV broadcasts, RTÜK (High Board for Radio and TV), and a number of TV channels were issued warnings for having broadcast the clip.\nThe 2006 album title \"Yurtta aşk, cihanda aşk\" (Love in country, love in universe), a reference to Atatürk's famous phrase - peace in the country, peace in the world - was released in June 2006. In the meantime, Gülşen's private life also got a lot of coverage in the Turkish news media and gossip tabloids. In order to reach the international audience, she uses the name \"Gulshen\" to assure a correct pronunciation of her given name.\nIn 2009 she has released her current album titeled \"Önsöz\" in which she has written all of the songs.\n\n\"Be Adam (O man!)\" (1995)\n\"Erkeksen (If you are a man)\" (1998)\n\"Şimdi (Now)\" (2001)\n\"Of...Of...\" (2004)\n\"Yurtta aşk, cihanda aşk (Love at home, love in the world)\" (2006)\n\"Ama bir farkla (But with a difference)\" (2007)\n\"Önsöz (Prologue)\" (2009) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/G%C3%BCl%C5%9Fen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
