He is known for combining classical and electronic music in his compositions, and for an unconventional approach to the piano, in which he mixes a grand piano, upright piano, Rhodes piano, drum machine, and Moog Taurus. He was taught to play the piano by Nahum Brodski, a student of the last protégé of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It was through this training that Nils began to immerse himself in the styles of the classical pianists before him as well as contemporary composers.\n\nToday Nils Frahm works as an accomplished composer and producer from his Berlin-based Durton Studio. His unconventional approach to an age-old instrument, played contemplatively and intimately, has won him many fans around the world. For a musician this early in his career, Frahm displays an incredibly developed sense of control and restraint in his work, catching the ear of many fans. \n\nAs the recognition continues to grow for his previous solo piano works Wintermusik (2009) and The Bells (2009), 2011 saw the release of his critically acclaimed record Felt on London label Erased Tapes. The album was followed by the solo synthesiser EP Juno and Screws (2012) – a birthday gift to his fans he recorded while recovering from a thumb injury. Nils released his follow up to Juno titled Juno Reworked (2013) with guest reworks by Luke Abbott and Clark.\n\nNow Nils returns with his new album Spaces expressing Frahm’s love for experimentation and answering the call from his fans for a record that truly reflects what they have witnessed during his concerts.\n\nhttp://nilsfrahm.com | http://erasedtapes.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nils+Frahm\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
