His latest album was released on March 18, 2008 and is titled Sixes & Sevens. Titles include \"Morning After Midnight\", \"Twee Twee Dee\", and \"Drowning Head First\", the latter a duet between Green and his girlfriend.\n\nIn January 2008, The Moldy Peaches began having a resurgence in popularity, due to their music being included in the hit indie film Juno.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Green\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
