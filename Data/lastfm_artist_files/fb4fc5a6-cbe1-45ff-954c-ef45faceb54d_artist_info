The five piece played locally until early 2007 when spring support slots with Saosin at Leeds Cockpit (03.05.07) and later Paramore at the Colchester Arts Centre (10.06.07) saw them attract media attention from the likes of Kerrang, Musicscoop and NME. In July 2007 they supported Tonight Is Goodbye on their summer tour along with Death Can Dance and then later that month were featured in Kerrang! magazine in their new music section. The group were then recruited as support for firstly Fightstar on their September tour and then Elliot Minor in October 2007.
