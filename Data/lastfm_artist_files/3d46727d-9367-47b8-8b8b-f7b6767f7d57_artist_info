On May 13th, 2016, Agalloch announced their disbandment. John Haughm released the following statement regarding the status of Agalloch:\n\n\"After being inundated by a barrage of responses, I feel that I should clarify some things. I take full responsibility for the decision to part ways with the other guys. It was difficult, well thought-out, and something that had been culminating over the past couple of years. I simply could not continue any further with the band as it was. I had to make a change as my motivation and inspiration had started to completely deteriorate. Whether this is the permanent end of Agalloch altogether or a possible fresh start, I don't know. I probably won't know for awhile. The band has simply been reduced back to its founding, visionary member for the first time in 20 years. Beyond that, the future is unknown.\"\n\nFor twenty years the Pacific Northwest group defined what it means to combine influences from a variety of musical genres into one brooding, colossal, and cinematic sound that provides the soundtrack to existential themes concerning man, nature, loss, and death.\n\nAfter two demo releases in the late 90s the band released three full-length albums: Pale Folklore (1999), The Mantle (2002), and Ashes Against the Grain (2006). “The Mantle” has since been heralded as a classic for having been one of the first albums to combine elements from black metal, neo-folk, progressive rock, post-rock, and ambient music. The influence of this record can be heard in many so-called “post-black metal” bands today.\n\nIn 2008 Agalloch began re-releasing their demos, B-sides, and EPs under their own Dammerung Arthouse label. In 2010 their fourth album Marrow of the Spirit made number one on numerous critic’s top ten lists. In between each of these full-lengths the band pushed on the flexible boundaries they had developed around themselves through a series of EPs that found the band experimenting with post-rock/instrumental rock (The Grey, 2004), neo-folk/psychedelic folk (“The White EP, 2008) and a mammoth twenty-minute epic work entitled Faustian Echoes (2012) released through Dammerung Arts. Their fifth and last full-length album The Serpent & the Sphere (2014) has continued to earn praise for solidifying the now identifiable sound of the band.\n\nAgalloch earned a reputation for explosive and emotional live performances. They sold out tours across Europe and the US and played a variety of major international festivals including: Roadburn, Inferno, Ragnarok, Tomahawk, Noctis, Asymmetry Fest, Maryland Deathfest, Scion Fest and others. The band took special care constructing the environment of each and every show with wood, incense, and imagery taken directly from their home in the Northwest. Such care made an Agalloch show more than just a typical heavy metal concert.\n\nAgalloch - Bandcamp\nAgalloch - Dämmerung Arts\nAgalloch - Discogs\nAgalloch - Facebook\nAgalloch - Official Site\nAgalloch - RateYourMusic\nAgalloch - Store\nAgalloch - Twitter\n\n---Discography------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStudio albums:\n1999 - Pale Folklore\n2002 - The Mantle\n2006 - Ashes Against the Grain\n2010 - Marrow of the Spirit\n2014 - The Serpent & the Sphere\n\nEPs:\n1997 - From Which of This Oak (demo)\n1998 - Promo 1998 (demo)\n2001 - Of Stone, Wind and Pillor\n2003 - Tomorrow Will Never Come\n2004 - The Grey EP\n2004 - Agalloch / Nest (split with Nest)\n2008 - The White EP\n2012 - Faustian Echoes\n\nCompilations:\n2008 - The Demonstration Archive 1996-1998\n2010 - The Compendium Archive\n\nSingles:\n2004 - A Fragment (Second Phase)\n2010 - Nebelmeer (split with Mathias Grassow)\n2010 - Fragment 4\n2010 - Scars of the Shattered Sky\n2010 - Where Shade Once Was\n2011 - The Death of Man III\n2011 - The Wolves of Timberline\n2013 - Nihil Totem\n2013 - The Weight of Darkness\n2014 - Alpha Serpentis (Unukalhai) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Agalloch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
