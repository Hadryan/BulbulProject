Joey DeMaio was a bass/pyro technician for Black Sabbath, who were playing a show in England at the time, and Ross the Boss was the guitarist of a band called Shakin' Street. The whole thing started when the two locked themselves in a locker room to find out which one could play the guitar harder and faster.\n\nAfter agreeing that they would found a band, the two took in Eric Adams, the \"man with lungs of leather\", as their vocalist, and Donny Hamzik as their drummer. They released their first album, \"Battle Hymns\", with this lineup in 1982. On their second release, \"Into Glory Ride\" (1983), Scott Columbus was introduced as their new drummer, along with his custom made stainless steel drums (regular ones would not endure his aggressive style).  The contract for Into Glory Ride was also signed in the band's own blood. \n\nManowar's third album, Hail to England (1984), started a tour in Great Britain. However, the band were fed up with their current record company's dominant nature, and released yet another record during the same year; \"Sign of the Hammer\" was published by 10 Records - hence the song \"All Men Play on 10\" included on this album.\n\nIn the beginning of 1987, \"Fighting the World\" was released, featuring hit songs such as \"Fighting the World\", \"Black Wind, Fire and Steel\" and \"Defender\". Followed by a tour in Europe, \"Fighting the World\" was a success.\n\nTheir next album, \"Kings of Metal\" (1988), was widely dedicated to the fans of Manowar all around the world, as can be told by looking at the cover (plenty of different flags scattered around). This album also featured recordings with a large male choir, such as \"Blood of the Kings\" and \"The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)\". The title of this album is the reason that their fans (and also themselves) dub them \"The Kings of Metal\".\n\nNot being pleased by his career with Manowar, Ross the Boss quit the band at this point, and was replaced by David Shankle. Also, the drummer known as \"Rhino\" took Scott Columbus's place on Manowar's next release, \"The Triumph of Steel\" published in 1992. After finishing their \"Secrets of Steel\" tour, they were voted as the band that fans would most like to see in Russia, beating out Beatles and Michael Jackson.\n\n1996 saw the release of \"Louder than Hell\", with Scott Columbus back in the drums and a new talent, Karl Logan, in lead guitar. This album included hit tracks \"Gods Made Heavy Metal\", \"The Power\", \"Brothers of Metal (Pt.1)\" and \"Return of the Warlord\".\n\nAfter some more touring and the change of millennium, \"Warriors of the World\" was released in 2002, featuring tracks \"Warriors of the World (United)\" and one dedicated to Italian fans, \"Nessun Dorma\", which was earlier performed by Eric Adams on their show in Italy.\n\nManowar has also released six live-DVD's, \"Hell on Earth\" Parts I-V and \"The Day the Earth Shook - The Absolute Power\", with the unbelivable event of the 2005 Earthshaker festival.  A new EP called \"Sons of Odin\" was released in October 2006.  Their latest album was released at the end of February - beginning of March 2007, entitled \"Gods Of War\".\n\nAlso in 2007 Manowar started their own metalfest in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which is called the Magic Circle Festival.\n\nIn August 2008 Manowar released an one-song single,  'Die With Honor'. The song was also edited for the latest \"Thunder in the sky\" EP, part of \"The Asgard Saga\" forthcoming CD. The EP included the song \"Father\" recorded in 15 more languages other than English-another tribute of the band to their faithful fans all around the world!\n\nOfficial website: http://www.manowar.com\nOfficial Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/manowar\nOfficial Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/manowar\nOfficial myspace http://www.myspace.com/manowarofficial\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manowar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
