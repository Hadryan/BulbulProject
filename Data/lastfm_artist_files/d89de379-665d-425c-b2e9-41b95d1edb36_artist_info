The band name was taken from the famous children's author Shel Silverstein.\n\nAfter several lineup changes, the band acquired Billy Hamilton, a local fan who learned of the band's need for a bassist on the Internet message board \"The 905 Board\" (an Ontario area outreach board which used to be for local musicians). In Christmas of 2001, he joined the band after Shane Told helped him learn the music for the songs. Following a rehearsal on Boxing Day (December 26) in 2001, he officially debuted with Silverstein. The next spring, original guitarist Richard McWalter left the band to move to Victoria, British Columbia to study engineering. He was then replaced by Neil Boshart, childhood friend of Shane Told. The new lineup recorded a second EP, When the Shadows Beam, in preparation for their first tour in Eastern Canada.\n\nThe band then signed to Victory Records in October of 2002 with a complete lineup as Hamilton attempted to complete his secondary education one semester early. The January after, the band recorded their full-length debut CD When Broken Is Easily Fixed, released on the Victory Records label.\n\nIn 2005 the band performed on the Never Sleep Again tour with bands such as Aiden, Hawthorne Heights and Bayside—a tour during which Bayside's drummer John \"Beatz\" Holohan would be killed. In January-February 2006, they toured with fellow Canadians Simple Plan in Europe. They then toured Canada with the Taste of Chaos Tour, and also toured Europe, Japan, and Australia.\n\nThe band toured on the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, in support of their current studio album Discovering the Waterfront and an EP compilation 18 Candles: The Early Years. The Early years compiles the band's first two self-financed EPs with some acoustic and live material as well as single remix of the Discovering The Waterfront hit Smile In Your Sleep. Discovering the Waterfront was re-released in September 2006 with an extra song, the band's cover of Lifetime's Rodeo Clown and a DVD.\n\nIn 2006, Silverstein was nominated for a Juno Award in the \"Best New Band\" category, but lost to Bedouin Soundclash.\n\nIn Fall 2006, they headlined The Never Shave Again Tour, along with Aiden, It Dies Today, and He Is Legend. Following completion of their third CD, the band played a few shows in the spring, and then engaged in an all-summer tour with Rise Against. The band toured the United States in Fall 2007 with From Autumn to Ashes and then went on a month-long European tour with Blessthefall.\n\nFollowing tours of Australia and Japan in January 2008, the band played their first \"Cross-Canada\" headlining tour with Protest the Hero, Ill Scarlett and The Devil Wears Prada, which sold out across the country. They recently completed a U.S. tour with A Day To Remember, Protest the Hero and The Devil Wears Prada. Protest the Hero dropped off the Tour and Pierce the Veil took over for them on a few show dates. They completed a 2008 Europe tour in for May and June, including several festivals, and are playing a limited summer festival schedule.\n\nThe band's third full-length album, Arrivals And Departures, was released on July 3, 2007, and was designated by AP Magazine as one of the most eagerly anticipated CDs of 2007. Mark Trombino (Jimmy Eat World, Blink-182, Finch) produced the CD. As of early August, the CD had sold 62,000 copies.\n\nSilverstein contributed a new acoustic version of their song Red Light Pledge to the Punk Goes Acoustic 2 compilation, released May 8, 2007 through Fearless Records.\n\nSilverstein (presumably Told) is listed as a client of Melissa Cross, a voice coach for lead singers.\n\nAfter heavy touring for their album, Arrivals and Departures, in Canada, the US, the UK, and other areas in Europe during late 2007 and early 2008, which included the band's 1000th show in Paris, France, the band is taking the summer off. In a news post on their site, Silverstein's Paul Koehler said the band is now \"taking a bit of downtown time to write a new album!\" In addition to a few Canadian festival dates, the band has announced Japan dates for September, and ticketing sites are reporting United States dates for October and November. According to a post in the forums on their website by vocalist Shane Told, the album should be out early 2009.\n\n    * Shane Told – lead vocals, occasional guitar\n    * Paul Marc Rousseau – lead guitar\n    * Josh Bradford – rhythm guitar\n    * Bill Hamilton – bass, backing vocals\n    * Paul Koehler – drums, percussion <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Silverstein\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
