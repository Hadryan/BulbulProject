To the general public he is probably best known for his orchestral work, Boléro, which he considered a trivial work and once described as \"a piece for orchestra without music\".\n\nAccording to SACEM, Ravel’s estate earns more royalties than that of any other French musician. According to international copyright law, Ravel’s works are public domain since January 1, 2008 in most countries. In France, due to anomalous copyright law extensions to account for the two world wars, they will not enter the public domain until 2015. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maurice+Ravel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
