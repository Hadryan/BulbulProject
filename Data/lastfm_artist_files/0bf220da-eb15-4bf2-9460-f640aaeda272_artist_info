Amongst other Oswald and Ernestus aliases is Basic Channel and they run a label under the same name, which upon closure in 1995 was followed by the infamous Chain Reaction.\n\nOne of several anonymous projects linked to the mysterious Berlin dub-techno duo Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus, Rhythm & Sound released a series of 10\" records on Burial Mix and 12\" records on Rhythm & Sound, both labels part of the Basic Channel group.\n\nVon Oswald and Ernestus' Rhythm & Sound recordings are much more dub-influenced and less techno-orientated than the duo's previous, and more legendary, dub-techno recordings as Basic Channel and Maurizio. Where those earlier recordings synthesized a Detroit-influenced style of minimal techno with dub-reggae bass lines, the late-'90s Rhythm & Sound productions emphasized the dub-reggae aesthetic rather than the more dancefloor-orientated techno sound of the early-'90s Basic Channel and Maurizio recordings. Thus, the Rhythm & Sound records, which often featured reggae vocalist Paul St. Hilaire, weren't quite as popular or well-known as the duo's Basic Channel recordings, which instead retained their popularity over the years, becoming quite legendary and oft-cited within the techno scene. \n\nNonetheless, von Oswald and Ernestus' Rhythm & Sound work prevailed into the early 2000s, being compiled on two listener-friendly CDs, Showcase and Rhythm & Sound. \n\n- Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide\n\nThey also released a special bundle of seven 7-inches using basically the same riddim with slight variations. On these seven vinyls they collaborate with various artists. These tracks have been compiled on See Mi Yah and remixed on See Mi Yah Remixes. They also released two compilations earlier: W/ The Artists and The Versions. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rhythm+&+Sound\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
