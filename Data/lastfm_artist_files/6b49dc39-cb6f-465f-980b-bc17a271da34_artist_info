Gilles Peterson played the track at first on his famous now called Worldwide-show.\nAlthough they are best known for their remixing work (particularly the ones collected on the 1998 double album The K&D Sessions), the duo has also gained a reputation around Europe for their live DJ performances, and to a lesser extent, their original compositions. \n\nDorfmeister also works with Rupert Huber under the name Tosca. Kruder released a solo album under the name Peace Orchestra in 1999 and released under the name Voom Voom with two other musicians the album Peng Peng on the label !K7 in 2006.\n\nKruder and Dorfmeister own their own recording studio, G-Stone Records, which releases some of its own albums, as well as others by Peace Orchestra, Dub Club, and Sugar B..\n\n2010 saw the 16th anniversary of Kruder & Dorfmeister and their record label G-Stone Recordings which resulted in the release of the \"Sixteen F**kin Years Of G-Stone Recordings“ compilation and the development of the \"K&D Sessions Live“ show. The show included visuals by longtime G-Stone VJ collaborator Fritz Fitzke and MC performances by Earl Zinger and MC Ras T-Weed. With performances at The Big Chill, Berlin Festival and numerous other high profile festivals, the \"K&D Sessions Live“ show became an instant success and a world tour ensued. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kruder+&+Dorfmeister\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
