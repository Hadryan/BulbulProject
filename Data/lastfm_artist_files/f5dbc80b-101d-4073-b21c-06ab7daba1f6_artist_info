Not too later, he tried to play the guitar and listened to Erkin Koray and Cem Karaca.\n\nAfter all red heavy metal. The trip started with Metallica and Iron Maiden then became a Judas Priest and Dio fan. He founded a cover band named Blasphemous. They made their own songs (parodies) and played in Gulhane.\nIn college he choose to have a musical education.\nHe was writing some funny notes and adding in some lyrics. He shared this with his friends and tried to make a melody out of them.\nHe was playing the songs himself with an electric guitar.\nAt that time it all was just a hobby, but then things became serious and they made their first album Bol Vitamin.\nIn 1998 he died in a car accident that his friend was driving drunk.\n\nThe band chose oftenly to make parodies of popular Turkish/English songs (including \"Can't Touch This\" of MC Hammer and \"Day-O\" of BeetleJuice soundtrack) with funny lyrics. Some of their songs criticized the government using humor (like \"Saskin Demokrat\") while the others made fun of Turkish people who were in-between modernism and conservatism (like \"Turkish Cowboys\" and \"Ellere Var Da Bize Yok Mu\"). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Grup+Vitamin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
