Other members inc: Andy Bruce, Georgia Sands & Danny Wheeler.\n\nAfter Erland recorded a track –‘Coming Home’ produced by Nock for Tongs Butterfly recordings compilation- “What the folk vol2”- the three of them began writing and playing together around London. Following in the path of Pentangle, The Trees and early Fairport they decided to form  their group entitled “Erland and the Carnival.” \n\nCarnival are best known for their contemporary arrangements of traditional Scottish and English folk songs, including Sally Free and Easy, The Parting Glass, Was You Ever See and Love Is a Killing Thing collected by Ralph Vaughn Williams. The band have just finished recording their debut album at Damon Albarns Studio, 13 and have released material, independently, through various collaborative projects.\n \nThe band's name comes from the Jackson C Frank song My Name is Carnival after the band recorded their own version of the song from his album Blues Run the Game. They are inspired by the likes of super folk groups Pentangle and Fairport Convention.\n\nSites: Discogs. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Erland+and+the+Carnival\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
