Gravenhurst's first full-band line up featured Dave Collingwood on drums, who also plays with Azalea City Penis Club, and bassist Paul Nash. Nash soon left to concentrate on his own musical project North Sea Navigator, and was replaced by Huw Cooksley. Later, Robin Allender, and Alex Wilkins joined on bass and guitar respectively.\n\nTalbot initially played all of the instruments on the recordings; Dave Collingwood took on the increasingly complex drum parts on 'Fires in Distant Buildings',  and again on 'The Western Lands' (2007). Collingwood played in the live band from 2000, and left in 2008.\n\nTalbot collaborated with Guy Bartell in Bronnt Industries Kapital.  He kept a blog, The Police Diver's Notebook and edited an adult web comic, Ultraskull.\n\nHis death was announced on the 4th of December 2014.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gravenhurst\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
