During recording to distance them from everyday life the band took to the remote Polish mountains. This new, inspiring environment proved to be the perfect setting to record, resulting in an album filled with emotional, ambient and energetic soundscapes.\n\n‘Earthshine’ was produced by Zbigniew Preisner, renowned as one of the Worlds foremost composers of music for film and theatre. Zbigniew tracked the band down after hearing them on the radio and offered his experience and expertise. An offer that couldn’t be refused or understated ‘Working with such a great composer brought a new perspective to our compositions, Zbigniew’s invaluable experience has certainly enriched us as musicians’ states Maciej. ‘We put our all in to ‘Earthshine’ our very beings, what we have created makes us very proud’\n\nLine-up:\nAdam Waleszynski (guitar)\nMaciej Karbowski (guitar, synth)\nPrzemek Weglowski (bass)\nTomasz Stolowski  (drums)\n\nfor more, please visit their official website www.tidesfromnebula.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tides+From+Nebula\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
