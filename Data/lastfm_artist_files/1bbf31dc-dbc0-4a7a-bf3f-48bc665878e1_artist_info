Their debut album as Local Natives, \"Gorilla Manor\", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as \"afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies\". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.\n\nUtilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single \"Breakers\".\n\nOfficial website: http://www.localnatives.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Local+Natives\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
