The band consists of sisters Este Arielle Haim (born March 14, 1986), Danielle Sari Haim (born February 16, 1989) and Alana Mychal Haim (born December 15, 1991), along with drummer Dash Hutton (son of Danny Hutton and previously a member of the bands Wires on Fire and Slang Chicken) and keyboardist Tommy King. Most frequently compared to Fleetwood Mac, HAIM's sound has been described as \"nu-folk-meets-nineties-R&B\"(by the BBC)  and \"music that sounds like it was written on a lakeside retreat attended by Stevie Nicks, John Waite and En Vogue\" (by the Guardian newspaper). The band played at the 2013 Glastonbury festival, earned a top ranking in BBC's Sound of 2013 poll, and later signed with Jay-Z's Roc Nation management group hoam.\n\nThe three sisters grew up in San Fernando Valley, and began playing covers in a band called Rockinhaim whose remaining members were their parents. Once the siblings had put that behind them, they began writing their own material. They formed the band in 2006, heavily influenced by Lindsey Buckingham (of Fleetwood Mac fame). They play a mix of Californian Soft Rock and R&B.\n\nIn September 2013, the band released their first studio album,\"Days Are Gone\". \n\nIn August 2015, the band released a remix of Tame Impala's track \"Cause I'm a Man\". \n\nFor the raï pop act see Haïm <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/HAIM\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
