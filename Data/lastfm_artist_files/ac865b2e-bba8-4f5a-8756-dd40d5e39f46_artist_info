They have collaborated with musicians such as Chino Moreno from Deftones, Fred Durst from nu metal band Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Tre Hardson from The Pharcyde, Skrillex and Nas.\n\nThe band released their first demo album, Neidermeyer's Mind, in 1993. Their debut album, Korn was released in 1994, where they featured the same musicians that had performed on Neidermeyer's Mind. The band began recording Life Is Peachy in April 1996, and released it on October 15, 1996.

Davis explained the album title: \"The title The Path of Totality refers to the fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time. That's how this album came together. I think all the producers feel the same way. I'm not sure it could ever happen again.\"\n\nKorn currently has over 36 singles, over 25 of which have charted. The band has over 5 video albums and over 34 music videos.\n\nKorn has sold over 19 million albums in the US, and over 40 million worldwide.

Eight of those releases are certified Platinum by the RIAA, and one is certified Gold. Korn have also earned seven Grammy nominations — two of which they have won (for \"Freak on a Leash\" and \"Here to Stay\").\n\nKorn say they will release a new album soon in 2013, saying it will be aggressive, heavy and having \"in your face!\" vocals and to sound like their roots. Brain Welch also says he will perform at some concerts with them in January 2013. He also says he will later on rejoin the band. But he left the band originally to rededicate his life back to Christianity. While David, left and opened a bar in Bakersfield, California.\n\nThey were the first band to be labeled as nu metal, people say they were starting the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Alongside this genre, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, rap rock, alternative metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal with grunge and hip-hop. Their lyrics focus mostly on stuff like personal alienation, pain, social anger, issues, memories, personal views and thoughts and sometimes revenge. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. The band, especially their frontman Jonathan have rejected the metal label. Although Munky said he never considered the band as nu metal. In their Issues album, they reduced slightly the rap sounds they had, but returned to it with Take a Look in the Mirror going back to their roots and being very aggressive, but with See You On the Other Side, they took influences from industrial metal but went back to the sound of Untouchables and Issues with their Untitled album. These are examples of their musical style and direction.\n\nFormer Members\n\nBrian Welch – guitars, backing vocals (1992–2005)\nDavid Silveria – drums, percussion (1992–2006)\n\nhttp://www.korn.com\nGenre: Nu metal\nLabels: Immortal Records, Roadrunner Records <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Korn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
