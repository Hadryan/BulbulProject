Lissie has released 2 studio albums, 1 live album and 5 EPs. She released her EP, Lissie, in 2007 and her debut album, Catching a Tiger, was released in June 2010. Lissie’s latest EP, Cryin' to You was released in March 2014.\n\nBackground\nLissie was born and raised in Rock Island, Illinois, USA - her father is a physician and her mother is an interior designer. She was interested in singing and music from an early age. She played the title role of the musical Annie at the age of nine. \"In high school it seems like everyone has more drama than any other time in their life. So that was the time in my life where I really leaned on music as a way to stay sane\" she said in an interview.\n\nIn her senior year of high school, Lissie was expelled over, what she described, as \"something stupid that [she] did, but it was sort of like the culmination of just a lot of negative things that had happened\". She got her degree at an alternative outreach center. She spent two years at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, during which time she would open for musicians who visited the city. She collaborated with DJ Harry of SCI Fidelity Records on the song \"All My Life\", which featured on television shows House, The O.C., Veronica Mars and Wildfire. After spending a semester in Paris, she finished her studies to pursue a career in music. In 2007, she produced a four-song EP that received some airplay on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic.\n\nIn early 2008, Lenny Kravitz invited her to be the opening act for his Love Revolution Tour, after a friend tipped him about her MySpace page. Later that year, \"The Longest Road\", a song she co-wrote with DJ Morgan Page reached #4 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart. \"We met under that idea that he was going to remix a song of mine (...) But we decided to work on a new song together\", she told the Quad-City Times. The Deadmau5 remix of the track was nominated for a Grammy in the \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\" category.\n\nReleases\n\nEP - Lissie (2007 and re-released in 2013)\n\nEP release - Why You Runnin' (2009)\nHer EP, Why You Runnin', produced by Bill Reynolds of Band of Horses, was released in November 2009 on Fat Possum. One of the songs, Oh Mississippi, was co-written with Ed Harcourt, whom she met through a mutual friend. The EP was listed amongst Paste magazine's \"Eight Most Auspicious Musical Debuts of 2009\". In early 2010, she toured various venues in the United Kingdom supporting Ohio-born singer-songwriter Joshua Radin.\n\nCatching a Tiger (2010)\nLissie signed with Sony Music UK's Columbia Records. Her debut album, Catching a Tiger, was released on June 21, 2010. The album was recorded in Nashville in 2009 and produced by Jacquire King. The first single from the album, In Sleep, was selected as Track of The Day by Q Magazine on 13 March 2010. A second single, When I’m Alone, was released alongside the album; it would later be chosen by iTunes UK as their song of the year 2010.\n\nLive at Shepherd's Bush Empire (2011)\n\nEP - Covered Up With Flowers (2011)\n\nBack to Forever (2013)\nLissie's sophomore album, Back to Forever, was released on September 8, 2013. It features the singles “Shameless” and “Further Away (Romance Police)”\n\nEP - Love in the City (2013).\n\nEP - Cryin' To You (2014)\nIn March 2014, Lissie released a critically acclaimed independent EP of cover versions called Cryin' To You. The 5-track EP features an eclectic mix of popular covers - Judas Priest’s Electric Eye, One Direction’s ballad The Story of My Life, Mother by Danzig, Hold On We're Going Home by Drake and Bob Dylan's To Ramona.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lissie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
