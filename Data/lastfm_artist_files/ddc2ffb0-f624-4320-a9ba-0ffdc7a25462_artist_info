Some lovely, classically-tinged moments. \"\n\nRaw 42: \"floating in a black, empty void framed by distant stars, all is quiet. suddenly there is a faintly imagined trickle of sound which rapidly becomes more distinct...\n\nInfluences: Pink Floyd, Rush, Tomita, David Bowie, Yes, Genesis (early), Kitaro, Vangelis, The KLF, Radio Head, The Crystal Method, Depeche Mode, NIN, Shostakovich, Debussy, Howard Shore, Philip Glass, Danny Elfman, Copeland, Strauss ( both ), Bach, Mozart... etc...\n\nPartial Discography:\n\nEarly Relases: CD-Rs/DAMs(mp3.com, ampcast, cafepress, etc)\n\nNotes From Cyberspace(1999)\nThe Stray-light Suites(2000)\nMetropolis(2000)\nSpaces(2001)\nMusic for Space Travel(2001)\nRelics (Released for \"Digital Star streams\")\n: I.L.L.U.S.I.O.N.S : (2002)\nN3UR0M4NC3R (A William Gibson Tribute) (2002)\nState of the Art (2002)\nVOX (2002)\nLords of the Earth (2003) \nTrantasia (2003)\nBuilt for the Future (2003)\nNemesis: A Cyberpunk Gothic Tale (2003)\nWide Screen (2004)\nThe Art of Trance (2004)\nChill Zone (2004)\n\nReleases through Blue Water Records (distributed though IODA): \n\nLife in the Machine (2005) \nThe Priciple of Chill (2006)\n\nwww.wintermutemusic.com\n\n2.
