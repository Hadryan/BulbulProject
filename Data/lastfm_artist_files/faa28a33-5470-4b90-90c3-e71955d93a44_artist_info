On May 3rd, 2014, Banks was labeled as an 'Artist To Watch' by Fox Weekly.\n\nBanks started writing songs at the age of 15. She taught herself piano when she received a keyboard from a friend to help her through her parents' divorce. She says she \"felt very alone and helpless. I didn't know how to express what I was feeling or who to talk to.\" Drawing from inspirations likeFiona Apple and Lauryn Hill, Banks focuses on the duality of soulful earthly emotion and ethereal atmospheric sounds. After reaching a large number of listeners on her Soundcloud page, she began working with the label Good Years. Her first official single, called Before I Ever Met You was released in February 2013. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Banks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
