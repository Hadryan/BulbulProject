They recorded one EP together in 1999 and played a few short tours, during which time she met Damien Jurado and Pedro the Lion. She then moved to Seattle to attend Cornish College briefly before deciding to focus on a solo recording career. Her appearance on the song \"Parking Lot\", from Damien Jurado's album Ghost of David, brought her to the attention of famed record label Sub Pop who signed her in 2000.\n\nHer debut album When We Were Small was released on 22 January 2001. The album featured Eric Fisher (who Thomas met at performance art school in Seattle) on guitar and keyboards and Andy Myers on drums.\n\nFisher and Myers returned for 2003's follow-up Only With Laughter Can You Win.\n\nThomas released her third album, If Songs Could Be Held, in 2005.\n\nHer fourth album These Friends of Mine, was recorded in collaboration with Sufjan Stevens who plays guitar and banjo as well as providing some vocals, and Denison Witmer. \n\nShe released a holiday album called A Very Rosie Christmas in November 2008 through her own record label.\n\nHer 2012 album is entitled \"With Love\".
