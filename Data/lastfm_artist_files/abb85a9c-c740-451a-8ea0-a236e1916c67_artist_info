Zee Avi on this song: “This song was inspired by everything i’ve experienced/read/watched/heard of from movies or stories, about one’s lover being far away for Christmas, be it serving in the army, college, another country, peace corps etc… In a way, it’s also about not losing hope. (…) The words in this one are simple and direct. (…) I stayed with the ‘silent movie feel’ as i think it suits the song.”\n\nZee Avi's debut album 'Zee Avi' was released May 19, 2009. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zee+Avi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
