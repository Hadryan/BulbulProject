live reputation, their cacophonous multi-layered sound along with stunning live visuals setting them apart\" Q Magazine\n\n\"An extraordinary widescreen technicolor epic of a song...a stunning single by a stunning band...\"\nTom Robinson, BBC6\n\n\"orchestral rockers Revere, who combine the fiery melodrama of Muse with the rousing chamber-pop of Arcade Fire. They could, and should, be huge\" Stephen Dalton, The Times\n\n\"Their sound is so utterly enormous. If you took the baroque pop stylings of Broken Records, the chamber-orchestral power of Godspeed You! Black Emperor and the great guitar whirlpools of I Like Trains you might be close - then multiply it by a big number\" Manchester Music \n\n\"The Escape Artist is probably one of the grandest pieces of music you will hear this year, haunting and performed to the highest of standards…I am in awe of the beauty of the piece\"\nInsiders Guide\n\n\"Revere are a band who provide almost the perfect soundtrack. This eight piece London outfit manage to go from strength to strength with each and every release\"\nUK Music Review\n\n\"A kaleidoscopic mess of noise, intensity and harmony - worth checking out\"\nSubba-Cultcha\n\n\"Wow, this is what I call epic stuff…a bit like Nick Cave meets Arcade Fire meets Sigur Ros!! Big sound, big songs, big excitement!! And, big future, hopefully!\"\nToxic Pete\n\n\"Can't wait to hear more from this band…they could be one of the best finds of the year\"\nIs This Music\n\n\"Warm waves of shimmering, beautiful yet dramatic music\"\nLoud Horizon Music\n\n\"Wonderful post rock in the vein of Sigur Ros and Arcade Fire\"\nDie Shellsuit, Die!\n\n\"Gospel for the space-age generation...\"\nThe Times\n\n\"Beautifully unpredictable...\"\nMOJO Magazine\n\n\"One of the best bands you've never heard of...\"\nThe Guardian Weekend\n\n\"Stuff this special and so uninterfered with doesn't come along often.\"\nManchester Music\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Revere\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
