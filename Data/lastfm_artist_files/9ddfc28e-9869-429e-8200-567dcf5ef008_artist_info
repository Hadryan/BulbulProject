F. B.,’ says Dr Alex Paterson, who has embarked on the new High Frequency Bandwidth project with Dom Beken.\n\nThe two men are about to make some Huge F***ing Broohaha with their mission to inject some original hiphop innovation, sonic anarchy and earth-level raunch into the electronic foragings they’ve become known for with, for starters, The Orb.\n\nDom, making radio and TV commercials, also finds time for a band called Belka and Stelka, who released last year’s Tales From The Projection Room album. He started as a drummer in Liverpool after finishing his history degree there, going on to the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. Dom started hanging out at the city’s Parr Street Studios, graduating from making tea to programming and engineering, working with artists including Manson, Echo and the Bunnymen, Pete Wiley and Graeme Park. Since relocating to London he has worked with names including Bowie, Lulu, Placebo’s Brian Molko, Liberty X and Pink Floyd’s Rick Wright. A long-term collaboration with Pink Floyd’s touring bassist Guy Pratt not only led to scoring TV programmes like Channel 4’s Spaced but to his old friend Dr Alex Paterson.\n\nAlex is, of course, The Orb: for 20 years the ultimate embodiment of the acid house spirit, before and beyond, from early avant electronic and ambient to the furthest galaxies with major success. The Orb recently released acclaimed album The Dream while currently enjoying a flurry of reissues which now make all their albums up until 2001’s Cydonia available in deluxe form.\n\nAlex loves a good satellite project: first himself, Dom and Guy formed the Transit Kings with original Orb member Jimmy Cauty, making the Living In A Giant Candle Winking At God album and touring festivals. After that, Alex and Dom’s Heavy Flapping Bollocks were inflamed with creative juices bursting to escape and, while Dom joined in Orb activities, H.F.B. started to materialise.\n\nIt cannot be overlooked that Dom’s studio, where the pair cook up their intoxicating sonic stews, is the old projection room at Ealing Studios, legendary home of classic British comedy, horror and war movies since the 1930s. With the ghosts of Will Hay and Charles Hawtrey stalking the corridors, some spirit of mischief can’t fail to seep into the air, mixing with Dom’s live playing and production flights steered by the Head, Feet and Bonkers noise ratios of the good Doctor. ‘Horrific Bush Fire’ charts an a slow-boat to exotic hiphop climes complete with mutated guitar and wailing gospel vocal while ‘High Five Brother’ marks Alex singing, a throaty soul counterpart to the flying female vocals. ‘Hip Hop Blue Film’ takes a denser route through the sonic undergrowth.\n\nhttp://www.highfrequencybandwidth.com\n\n© Kris Needs 2009 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/High+Frequency+Bandwidth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
