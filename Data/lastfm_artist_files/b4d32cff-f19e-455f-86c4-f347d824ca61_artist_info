Consisting of musician/producer David A. Stewart (often referred to as Dave Stewart) and singer-songwriter Annie Lennox, they formed in 1980 after the breakup of their former band The Tourists. Best known for their 1982 single \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" and album of the same name, they had a striking visual image, with Lennox having a very androgynous persona. They have described their music style as \"for intelligent dancers\".\n\nBoth Stewart and Lennox have had success, particularly as songwriters, outside of Eurythmics. They have sold over 75 million albums worldwide as a group. Eurythmics originally came together in 1980 and disbanded in 1990. They reunited in 1999 and split again in 2005.\n\nAfter a Krautrock-inspired debut, their second and third albums were firmly in the electronic avant-garde of the time, somewhat akin to contemporaries such as The Human League and Ultravox, as befitting their striking visual style. Still, their albums 'Touch' and 'Sweet Dreams' sold very well and earned them a large fan following in the new wave scene, the strength of the song \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" (also known as just \"Sweet Dreams\") helping greately. Their fourth album (not counting the controversial soundtrack '1984') was 'Be Yourself Tonight', which became a commercial smash certified double platinum and planted them firmly in the synth pop genre in many people's minds. From this album came several popular singles, but ironically the single most lingering on playlists and on peoples' minds over the years has been the avant-garde single \"Sweet Dreams\".\n\nOther popular tunes by the group include \"Don't Ask Me Why\", \"Would I Lie To You?\", \"Who's That Girl?\", and \"Here Comes The Rain Again\". Their style has been described variously as dance music, new wave, electropop, and the like with some songs having an aggressive rock inspiration. As well, Stewart was once notably married to former Bananarama and Shakespear's Sister member Siobhan Fahey.\n\nIn the 70s, Lennox and Stewart were a romantic couple. The complexities of their relationship over the years has fueled the emotionally cathartic nature of many of their songs.\n\nFor more details on the Eurythmics, visit the fan site: http://www.eurythmics.me.uk/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eurythmics\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
