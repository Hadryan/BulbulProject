His latest projects include a collaboration with the honey-voiced Isobel Campbell, as well as a long anticipated collaboration with Greg Dulli called The Gutter Twins.\n\nIsobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan form a unique combination of gruff vocals and dulcet voices. They have released three albums so far: Ballad of the Broken Seas, which received a nomination in the 2006 Mercury Awards, Sunday at Devil Dirt, which was released in May 2008. The album received US release in Fall 2008. And finally their third album Hawk was released in August 2010.\n\nIn November 2011, Lanegan released Blues Funeral  on  4AD .
