Their own works have been named as ''Psychedelic Folk'';\n\nEspecially with their stage performances Gevende highlights include improvisation and work with different musicians. Every stage they perform is an open Jam Session and they've had many chances to peform with different musicians. The group's composition process comes to light competely on the stage.  In every stage performance Gevende let the songs flow to the current mood and the previously composed songs are carried into another dimension. This results in every song being heard in a different way on every stage. The group has a peculiar and wonderful sound.\n\nVocals are used just like an instrument and join the performance with improvisation. Words become like notes from other instruments. Words have no special meaning and few of the compositons have the vocals written, everything changes in every stage performance.\n\nAhmet K.
