Mi is Finnish and was working as a model to make ends meet and L'au (who's French) was working in the music industry (soundtracks). They fell deeply and immediately in love, and after a short period of moving from apartment to apartment in Paris, they gave everything up and decided to move in a small cabin in woods in Finland, so they could be alone together in peace and spend their time discovering each other and their music.\n\nThey released their self titled debut album on October 2005 on Young God Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mi+and+L%27au\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
