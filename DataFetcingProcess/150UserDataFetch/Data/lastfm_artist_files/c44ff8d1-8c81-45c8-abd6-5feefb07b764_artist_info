The band consists of Paul Banks (vocals and guitar), Sam Fogarino (drums), and Daniel Kessler (guitar and backing vocals).\n\nThe band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar, with a snare heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division and The Chameleons.\n\nThe band formed in 1997 when Daniel Kessler met drummer Greg Drudy, previously a member of post-hardcore/screamo band Joshua Fit For Battle and Hot Cross, on the New York University campus. Kessler later added Carlos D. on the bass after meeting him in a history class. The line-up was complete after Kessler ran into Paul Banks, a friend whom he had met in Paris. In 2000, Sam Fogarino, whom the band knew through his job at a local record store, replaced Drudy. Carlos Dengler, who was responsible for bass and keyboards, left the band in 2010, and hasn't been replaced, but announced various names to help them perform live.\n\nThe band released Direction on the soundtrack of the television program 'Six Feet Under' on June 28, 2005.  Shortly thereafter they left Matador for a major label.\n\nOur Love to Admire was released on July 10, 2007 in the USA (July 9 in the UK) to generally favorable reviews.  The Heinrich Maneuver was its first single.\n\nTheir self-titled LP was released on September 7th 2010 and the tracks Barricade , Summer Well , Lights , and Try It On have been issued as singles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Interpol\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
