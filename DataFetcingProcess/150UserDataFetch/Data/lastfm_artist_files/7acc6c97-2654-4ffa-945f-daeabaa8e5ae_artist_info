Music fans know him as the founding member and producer of A Perfect Circle who featured Tool’s Maynard James Keenan on vocals as well as members of Smashing Pumpkins, Queens of the Stone Age and Marilyn Manson. Rather than simply rest on the multi- platinum success of that project, Howerdel decided it was time to start fresh, under the pseudonym ASHES dIVIDE, with a new collection of songs and collaborators. Island Records’ chief, Antonio “L.A.” Reid announced in early January 2008 that they had signed ASHES dIVIDE to their storied roster.\n\nThe proficient musician played nearly every instrument on the upcoming album. The drums were handled by his A Perfect Circle band mate Josh Freese. Maynard James Keenan’s 11 year old son, Devo, added some gorgeous cello. With Howerdel providing such a rich and layered production style to the sessions, legendary engineer, Alan Moulder (My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails) was enlisted to mix the results. Fans of APC and bands like The Cure and Smashing Pumpkins will fall for the album’s alluring blend of rock bombast and dark atmospherics. The internet has been buzzing about the debut single “The Stone,” and rock and alternative radio has already added the song to their rotations. The album, Keep Telling Myself It’s All Right, will be released in March. In the meantime, Howerdel is putting a touring band together for a worldwide tour.\n\nUnited States\n2005 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ASHES+dIVIDE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
