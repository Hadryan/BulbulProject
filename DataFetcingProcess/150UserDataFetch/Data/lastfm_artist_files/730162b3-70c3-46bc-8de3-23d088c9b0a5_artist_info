Two months later they headed into late-night sessions in studios all over Reykjavík, recording at nights - sleeping at days. The outcome was the highly acclaimed ‘Blue’, a 2 CD mixing dark ambient with rock. After the release Pornopop played few gigs with Sigur rós and Fuck before vanishing into the basement again.\n\nIn 2006 Pornopop released ‘...and the slow songs about the dead calm in your arms’ which they recorded with their friend, Arnar Helgi Aðalsteinsson, from IDM/experimental band Plat.  \nPornopop have begun working on their third album ‘Two Lazy Tigers’ which is to be released in 2012.\n\n\n--\n\n\n2) A minor Czech beat/rock band formed around Belica brothers. Pornopop was a young club-based band, which relesed a demo album and a single at 2003. Pornopop was last seen live at 2005, and is probably disbanded at this time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pornopop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
