Starting out with dance floor-oriented techno, he later started to create ambient music and recently became \"more interested in designing sounds than beats\". Recent music is closer to glitch, clicks and cuts or IDM, accompanied with classical string instruments and other sounds. He works with his own tool created in MAX/MSP framework. Effects are controlled by midicontroller.\n\n\"While sensitively orchestrating his chamber musical qualities on his records or in his studio, his live performances are known for kicking some ass!\" From Shitkatapult website \n\nHe collaborated with Ellen Allien in 2003 on the album Berlinette, and again in 2006 on the album Orchestra of Bubbles.\n\nApparat's fourth album,The Devilâ€™s Walk released on 27 September 2011 through Mute Artists, began during a lengthy trip Apparat took in 2010 to Mexico, where he worked in a makeshift studio in the town of Sayulita.  \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Apparat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
