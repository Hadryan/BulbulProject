Different Drummer label  \n4) An Italian instrumental rock band \n\n\n1) Appaloosa was a folk band originally from Cambridge, Massachussets. It featured John Compton and Robin Beatteau. They put out one album produced by Al Kooper. After this the members went on to several projects, such as: Compton & Batteau, Batteaux, John Compton, David Batteau, and Pierce Arrow. Robin eventually ended up a very successful commercial jingle writer in the 1980's.\n\n3) The drum 'n' bass outfit Appaloosa, consisting of Ben McColl and Matthew Brooks, released a number of seminal singles on LTJ Bukem's Good Looking label during the 1990s, including a popular collaboration with DJ Orbit titled \"Nautilus.\" In the late '90s, Appaloosa signed with Rockers Hi-Fi's Different Drummer label and released a self-titled album that explored elements of electro and experimental electronica. It was an underrated classic, featuring magical compositions like \"(Time) and Again\" and \"Tranzco.\"\n\n4) Instumental band Appaloosa from Livorno, Italy. One of the hottest and the most overwhelming band in the Italian Crossover noise-dance panorama. Genuine dynamite, thick rhytms and a burning sound.\n\nDevotional sources: Don Caballero, Melvins, Shelac, No means No, Oneida.\nSounds like: Don Caballero, Oneida, Melvins, Shellac, No means No, Aphex Twin, Kraftwerk\n\nBIO\nAppaloosa is a project born in 1998 in Livorno (Tuscany), an instrumental sound which melt noise tones with funk and psychedelic attitudes. Two electric basses, creating geometric structures, emotionally filled with dynamics and grooves.\n\nThey took part several times to Arezzo Wave and shared the stage with One Dimensional Man, Zu, Perturbazione and many other Italian bands plus the wonderful 2004 evening on the main stage with  Karate, Black Rebel Motorcycle and Cypress Hill; not after long they have been invited at Tora Tora festival (supposed to be the italian Loolapalooza).\n\nSince the second full-lenght the band callled Giulio Ragno Favero as producer and sound egnineer, and  is part of the glorious Italian indie label Urtovox.\n\n\nLine up:\n\nNiccolò Mazzantini: Bass, Guitar, Synth, Organ, Drum Machine\n\nEnrico Pistoia: Bass, Synth, Organ\n\nMarco Zaninello: Drum, Synth, Drum Machine\n\nSimone Di Maggio: laptop, Drum Machine, Guitar  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Appaloosa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
