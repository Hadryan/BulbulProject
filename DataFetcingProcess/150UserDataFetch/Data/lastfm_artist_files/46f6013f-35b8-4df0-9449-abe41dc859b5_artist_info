Nil's passion and admiration for music stems from her father; Suavi Karaibrahimgil, who is also a musician although he is not currently active in the Turkish music industry.\n\nIn 2000, she graduated from Boğaziçi University with a degree in International Relations. She also further received the Crystal Apple prize award twice, which recognized her achievements in advertising. Besides academic success, Nil has found fortune in the Turkish music scene. Many of her songs deal with love, marriage and relationships. On January 21, 2010 she married Sertab Erener's brother Serdar Erener near the shore of the Nile River.\n\nUp to 2007, Nil has managed to release 3 successful albums along with several singles of her own here and there. In 2002, her debuting album titled, \"Nil Dünyası\" managed to bring her into the spotlight with hits that include, \"Kek\" and \"XL\". Two years later, Nil managed to follow up with another album called, \"Nil FM\" which also managed to see similar success as that of her first album. Some of the hit singles released from that album include, \"Gitme Yoksa…\", \"Akbaba\", \"Ben Aptal Mıyım?\" and \"Bronzlaşmak\" as well.\n\nIn 2006, Nil would go on to release her 3rd album called, \"Tek Taşımı Kendim Aldım\". The album managed to bring Nil with some further success with hits including, \"Pırlanta\", \"Peri\" and of course, \"Organize İşler Bunlar\" which is the original soundtrack of the movie Organize İşler. All of the three singles from this album managed to easily top most Turkish charts, which is quite a success considering that the Turkish music industry is a quite competitive one.\n\nIn late 2006, Nil released a single called, \"Yaş 18\" (Age 18) which is one of the two tracks she recorded for the soundtrack of the Turkish movie Sınav (Exam). Both the movie and the song deal with the pressure Turkish students face preparing for matriculation, as well as angst from coming of age.\n\nIn 2009, she released another album, Nil Kıyısında, featuring singles like \"Seviyorum Sevmiyorum\", \"Duma Duma Dum\" and \"Kırık\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nil+Karaibrahimgil\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
