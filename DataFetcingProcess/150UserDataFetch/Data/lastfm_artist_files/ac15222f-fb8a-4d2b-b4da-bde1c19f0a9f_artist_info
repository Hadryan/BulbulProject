The band is known for recording many rock operas. Early on, Savatage was a traditional heavy metal band, who stood out from the pack due to guitarist Criss Oliva's uncommonly heavy riffing and vocalist Jon Oliva's unique vocal stylings.\n\nFollowing the failure of FIGHT FOR THE ROCK, an attempt to commercialize their sound, Savatage began moving in a more operatic direction, releasing a number of rock opera albums in collaboration with producer Paul O'Neill.\n\nAfter the tragic death of Criss Oliva in 1993, the band soldiered on to continued critical acclaim but diminishing commercial success. However, Oliva and O'Neill lucked out when a single from DEAD WINTER DEAD, \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", managed to crack the singles chart. The song, a reworking of a classic Christmas hymn, acted as a launching pad for the immensely successful Trans-Siberian Orchestra project.\n\nSavatage is currently considered to on indefinite hiatus. Guitarist Chris Caffery, vocalist Zak Stevens, and even Oliva himself have all collaborated to some extent on each others' solo projects. Jon Oliva has a successful solo-project, Jon Oliva's Pain, and Zak Stevens and Jeff Plate have worked together in Machines of Grace.\n\nIn 2010 a best-of was released, \"Still the Orchestra Plays\", including their Japan Live '94 show on DVD.\nIn 2011 their entire catalogue was remastered and reissued.\n\nMembers:\nJon Oliva - Vocals & Keyboards (1979-1992, 1994-present), bass (1980-1981, 1994), rhythm guitar & drums (1994)\nZak Stevens - Vocals (1993-2000, 2008-present)\nChris Caffery - Guitars, backing vocals (1987-1988, 1989-1990, 1995-present)\nAl Pitrelli - Guitars (1995-1999, 2008-present)\nJohnny Lee Middleton - Bass, backing vocals (1986-present)\nJeff Plate - Drums (1994-present)\n\nEx-members:\nCriss Oliva - Guitars, backing vocals (1979-1993) (Deceased)\nSteve Wacholz - Drums (1979-1993)\nKeith Collins - Bass (1981-1985)\nAlex Skolnick - Guitars (1994)\n\nTouring members:\nChris Caffery - Rhythm guitars, keyboards (1987-1988, 1989-1990)\nJohn Zahner - Keyboards (1991-1992)\nWes Garren - Rhythm guitars, keyboards (1993)\nAndy James - Drums (1993)\nDamond Jiniya - Vocals (2001-2002)\nJack Frost - Guitars (2001-2002)\nJeff Waters - Guitars (2002)\n\nDiscography\nJon Oliva-eras (1978-1992, 2001-2002) \nCity Beneath the Surface (1982) (as Avatar)\nSirens (1983)\nDungeons are Calling (1984)\nPower of the Night (1985)\nFight for the Rock (1986)\nHall of the Mountain King (1987)\nGutter Ballet (1989)\nStreets (1991)\nGhost in the Ruins (1995) (Live, recorded 1987-1990)\nPoets and Madmen (2001)\n\nZak Stevens-era (1993-2000)\nEdge of Thorns (1993)\nHandful of Rain (1994)\nDead Winter Dead (1995)\nJapan Live '94 (1995) (Live)\nThe Wake of Magellan (1997)\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Savatage\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
