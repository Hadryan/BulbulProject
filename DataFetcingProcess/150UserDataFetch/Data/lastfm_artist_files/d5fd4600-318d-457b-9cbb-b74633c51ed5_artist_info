This time, Shannon truly captures the feeling of her electric live performances. She's a frequent road warrior, playing shows everywhere from South Dakota to Brazil.

Christina lends her graceful drumming skills to the mix, creating an airy backdrop for Shannon to stretch out and play.\n\nIn 2007 she released \"let in the light\" .  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shannon+Wright\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
