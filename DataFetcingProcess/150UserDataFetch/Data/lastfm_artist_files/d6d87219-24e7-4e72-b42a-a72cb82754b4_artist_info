His music is characteristic by unique exploration of electroacoustic nexus and emphasis on audiovisual aspects of art. From childhood he has been learning clarinet which later becomes the key instrument for his music - not only as “instrumental signature” but also as way of his compositional approach.\n\n\tFloex started to compose electronic music in 1996. His debut album Pocustone (2001) bridges relatively isolated genres such as nu-jazz, electronic and modern contemporary music.
