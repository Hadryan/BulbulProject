The foundation of his musical career began after high school with his 2 year musical education at the Mimar Sinan University which was then followed by 2 years at the Timur Selçuk school of music.  All was set into place after he studied another year of piano at Akademi Istanbul.\n\nIn 1997 he started off his professional career as a keyboardist for some of the biggest names in the Turkish alternative music scene.  Names such as Ogün Sanlısoy, Aylin Aslım, Koray Candemir and Demir Demirkan are only some of them.\n\nIn 2005, his (home recorded) debut album 'Sakin Olmam Lazım' was released by EMI Recording in Turkey.  The album has hints of classic Turkish blends and the raw angst present in rock.  The angst which literally swallows you up while watching Hayko Cepkin live is much more evident on his second album released in May of 2007.\n\nThe second album 'Tanışma Bitti' tells you just about everything you need to know about Hayko Cepkin. \n\nThe third album 'Sandık' was released in spring 2010. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hayko+Cepkin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
