Montevideo; September 21, 1964), is a critically acclaimed Uruguayan singer/songwriter who resides in Spain, began his recording career in the early 90's but didn't experience mainstream breakthrough success until his seventh album, Eco (2004), and its Oscar-winning song ''Al Otro Lado Del Río''.\n\nHe comes from a Jewish family that fled persecution in Germany. He studied to become an otolaryngologyst (i.e., ear, throat, and nose doctor) like his parents but ultimately chose to pursue his passion for music. \n\nDrexler made his full-length album debut with La Luz Que Sabe Robar (1992), followed by Radar (1994). In hopes of furthering his career, he went to Spain in 1995 upon the invitation of legendary singer/songwriter Joaquín Sabina , who showed him around the Madrid music scene and helped him secure an international recording contract. So impressed with Madrid that he chose to make his permanent residency there, Drexler got together with a band of Spanish musicians to re-record material from his first two albums along with new material and release it internationally as Vaivén (1996), the first of four albums on Virgin España. The highlights of Vaivén along with those of its three follow-ups, Llueve (1998), Frontera (1999), and Sea (2001), were later compiled on the best-of compilation La Edad Del Cielo (2004).\n\nUpon his switch to the Dro Atlántic label, Drexler's career reached new heights of success with the critically acclaimed Eco (2004). Most notably, the album includes the Oscar-winning song ''Al Otro Lado Del Río'', which was prominently  featured during the closing credits of the Walter Salles film The Motorcycle Diaries (2004). \n\nEco proved so successful, in fact, that it was re-released with bonus material as Eco² (2005). Subsequent albums include 12 Segundos de Oscuridad (2006), the double-disc live album Cara B (2008), and  Amar la Trama (2010). \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jorge+Drexler\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
