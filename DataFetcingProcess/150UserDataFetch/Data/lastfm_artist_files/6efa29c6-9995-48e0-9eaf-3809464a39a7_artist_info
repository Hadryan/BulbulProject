After releasing an album with her father at the age of fifteen, more than twenty years passed before she released three albums as an adult (5:55, IRM and Stage Whisper) to commercial and critical success. Gainsbourg has also appeared in many films, including several directed by Lars von Trier, and has received both a César Award and the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award. She is the daughter of English actress Jane Birkin and French singer and songwriter Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nGainsbourg made her motion picture debut playing Catherine Deneuve's daughter in the film Paroles et musique (1984). In 1986, Gainsbourg won a César Award for \"Most Promising Actress\" for L'effrontée, and, in 2000, she won \"Best Supporting Actress\" for the film La Bûche.\n\nGainsbourg made her musical debut with her father on the song \"Lemon Incest\" in 1984. Two years later, she released her debut album Charlotte for Ever, which was produced by her father.\n\nIn 2007, Gainsbourg appeared alongside Gael Garcia Bernal in Michel Gondry's La Science des rêves and as Claire in the Todd Haynes directed Bob Dylan biopic I'm Not There, also contributing a cover of the Dylan song \"Just Like a Woman\" to the film's soundtrack.\n\nIn 2006, Gainsbourg released her second album 5:55 to critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching the top spot on the French charts and achieving platinum status in the country. In the UK, the album was moderately successful, reaching #78 (The single The Songs That We Sing only made #129).\n\nGainsbourg has recently released her third studio album, IRM, which was produced by Beck. One of the influential factors in the album's creative process was her time spent filming Antichrist. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlotte+Gainsbourg\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
