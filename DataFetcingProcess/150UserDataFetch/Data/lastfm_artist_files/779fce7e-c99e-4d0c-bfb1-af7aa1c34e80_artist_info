Set to a traditional Egyptian tune, the single proved Koray to be an ingenious musician and arranger.\n\nOther major hits by Koray are Fesuphanallah, Istemem, Sevince, Öyle Bir Geçer Zaman ki , Estarabim, Arap Saçı, Yalnızlar Rıhtımı, Akrebin Gözleri and Çöpçüler.\n\nErkin Koray and Orhan Gencebay are the inventors of the electonic version of bağlama (a Turkish traditional musical instrument). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Erkin+Koray\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
