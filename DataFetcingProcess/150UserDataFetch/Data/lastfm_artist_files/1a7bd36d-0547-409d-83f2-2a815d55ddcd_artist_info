His first solo album entitled One Day at Home resulted in nine atmospherical tracks, evoking abstract landscapes and fairy tales for adults from song to song.\n\nWarmly acclaimed by the critics (One Day at Home has received special attention from the national press, notably from the printed media references TRAX and Les Inrockuptibles), Saycet’s first full-length has managed to capture the frailties of a lifetime. Both fleecy and tensed, elusive and introspective, the songs that compose One Day At Home sublimate melancholy and solitude. Saycet’s music is an invitation to daydreaming and would perfectly lend itself to the soundtrack of a contemplative walk.\n\nNow joined by vocalist Phoene Somsavath who brought her delicate signature, Saycet embraces vivid arrangements and crafts a brand of experimental pop. With discrete vocal samples that breeze in and vanish, waltzing melodies, layered keyboards and detailed electronics, Saycet takes the listener on a timeless journey. The one-year-long collaboration has given birth to the second album Through the Window, released in 2010.\n\nAs a live act, Saycet is also comprised of VJ Zita Cochet, whose video projections emphasize the cinematic aspect of their music. The images are colourful shapes and shades, bright lights fading out playing hide-and-seek with the melodies, and underline the poetry of their universe. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Saycet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
