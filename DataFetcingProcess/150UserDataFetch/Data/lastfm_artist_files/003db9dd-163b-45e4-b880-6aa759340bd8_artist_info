Nikki has released 2 full length albums, the critically acclaimed live album \"Ella... Of Thee I Swing\" (2008), and her debut studio album \"Nikki\" (2010).\n\nNikki recorded the Ella Fitzgerald classic \"Airmail Special\" for Verve Records and it was released in June 2007 on the album We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song. Produced by Tommy LiPuma, this track made Yanofsky the youngest singer ever to record for Verve.\n\nIn September 2008, Yanofsky released her first full-length album, a live CD/DVD concert package entitled \"Ella... Of Thee I Swing\". Supported by her production company, A440 Entertainment and distributed in Canada and Japan by Universal Music, it garnered critical acclaim and earned her two Juno Award nominations in 2009: 'New Artist of the Year' and 'Vocal Jazz Album of the Year'. She also won 'Favourite Jazz Artist' at the 2009 Canadian Independent Music Awards.\n\nSongwriters Stephan Moccio and Alan Frew chose Yanofsky to sing CTV’s broadcast theme for the 2010 Winter Olympics, \"I Believe.” The Song reached number one on the Canadian Hot 100 on the week of February 27, 2010. This made her the first Canadian artist to have a number one song on that chart since \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne topped the chart in 2007. The song was certified “Quadruple Platinum” for digital downloads in April 2010.\n\nNikki recorded her first studio album, Nikki, with 14-time Grammy Award-winning producer Phil Ramone. Along with the album-release of \"I Believe\", it includes some of Yanofsky’s first original works—writing in collaboration with Jesse Harris (of Norah Jones fame) as well as fellow Canadian songwriters Ron Sexsmith and Feist. It was released in April 2010 by Decca Records and was supported by an international tour. Nikki earned a Juno nomination for \"Vocal Jazz Album of the Year\", and won the WAVE Smooth Jazz Award for \"Female Vocalist of the Year.\"\n\nNikki has performed internationally at jazz festivals and major concert venues both solo and alongside such well-known artists as Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones, Wyclef Jean, Celine Dion, The late Marvin Hamlisch and The Count Basie Orchestra.\n\nIn 2008, Yanofsky received the Outstanding Youth in Philanthropy award from the Quebec Chapter of The Association of Fundraising Professionals. Over her career, she has helped raise over $10 Million for local, national and international charities. She is currently associated with The Montreal Children’s Hospital, The Children’s Wish Foundation and MusiCounts.\n\nhttp://www.nikkiyanofsky.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nikki+Yanofsky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
