For some reason, people enjoy seeing me lose my cherub like demeanor.\"\n\nJohn Pinette has been entertaining audiences around the world in a variety of ways for over fifteen years, but it is making people laugh that John enjoys most of all. He was named Stand-Up Comedian of the Year by the American Comedy Awards in 1999 and has received a Gemini Award nomination for his superb televised performance at The Montreal Comedy Festival in 2000.\n\nBorn just outside of Boston, Massachusetts, John has always had a gift for making people laugh. When he learned that he could actually make a living for doing so, John left behind his life as an accountant and began his comedy career. It wasn't long before he was touring comedy clubs around the country. Shortly thereafter, John got his big break when he was asked to tour with Frank Sinatra. Since then he has become a regular guest on The Tonight Show and The View.\n\nJohn has also enjoyed a long acting career in both television and film. Duets, starring Gwenyth Paltrow, Dear God, starring Greg Kinnear, and Junior, starring Arnold Schwarzeneger are just a few of John's film credits. He was a series regular on the hit series Parker Lewis Can't Lose, and starred as the car-jack victim in the final episode of Seinfeld. John will be seen in the summer of 2004 as the lovable 'Mr. Bumpo' in Artisan Entertainment's The Punisher starring Thomas Jane and John Travolta.\nJohn's first comedy CD, Show Me The Buffet, was an enormous success. A follow-up CD/DVD, I Say 'Nay Nay', is due out in the Spring of 2004.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Pinette\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
