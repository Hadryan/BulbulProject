The band currently consists of Jason Luis 'Jay Kay' Cheetham  (vocals), Matt Johnson (keyboards), Rob Harris (guitar), Paul Turner (bass), Derrick McKenzie (drums) , Sola Akingbola (percussion), Lorraine McIntosh (backing vocals) and Hazel Fernandez (backing vocals). The name \"Jamiroquai\" is derived from the Native American Iroquois tribe, with which Kay has said he identifies philosophically, combined with 'Jam', as in musical jamming.\n\nAfter Jay Kay auditioned unsuccessfully to be the singer of the Brand New Heavies, he decided to put together his own band. Jamiroquai's first single, \"When You Gonna Learn?\", was released in 1992 on the Acid Jazz label. Following its success, Kay signed a Â£1,000,000 eight-album record deal with Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The band enjoys worldwide popularity and is the best-known member of the early-1990s London-based acid jazz movement, alongside groups such as Incognito, Galliano, and Corduroy. Jamiroquai has since, however, moved in other musical directions.\n\nBand Members:\nJason \"Jay\" Kay - Vocals\nRob Harris - Guitar\nDerrick McKenzie - Drums\nPaul Turner - Bass\nSola Akingbola - Percussion\nMatt Johnson - Keyboards\nLorraine McIntosh - Backing vocals\nHazel Fernandez - Backing vocals\n\nFormer Members:\nToby Smith - Keyboards (1992-2002)\nWallis Buchanan - Didgeridoo (1992-2001)\nGavin Dodds - Guitar (1993-1994)\nSimon Katz - Guitar (1995-2000)\nStuart Zender - Bass (1992-1998)\nNick Fyffe - Bass (1998-2003)\nNick Van Gelder - Drummer (1993)\nDarren Galea aka DJ D-Zire - Turntables (1993-2001)\nAdrian Revell - Flute, saxophone\nWinston Rollins - Trombone\nSimon Carter - Keyboards (1999-2001)\nSia - Backing Vocals\nSam Smith - Backing vocals (2001-2007) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jamiroquai\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
