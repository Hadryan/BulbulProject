She grew up in Iskenderun (a city in Turkey) and went to Ankara for college. She studied at the American Culture and Literature Department at Bilkent University where she also enjoyed her years as an amateur singer and also joined drama clubs where she acted for three years. After she graduated fom Bilkent University; in 2002 she moved to Istanbul and started to seek her carreer in which she always dreamed to be...\"a song-writer and a singer\".\n\nFor a short time she studied with Randy Esen and joined gigs; sang in several events. She worked for the TV and production companies when she realised that she would only like to breath and live for music; thus gave everything up and started to work on her own and for her own music.\n\nIn 2004 she joined the group \"Funkalaturca\" as the group's vocalist where they performed shows for special events. (for the group info pls visit : www.funkalaturca.com) She is still the member of the group and touring on occassions.\n\nIn 2005 she started to write her own songs and worked with several musicians. In that year she gathered her songs and today is trying to make an album so as to be able to share them with everyone. In this project of hers, she recieved a very important support from Bülent Ortaçgil who offered to supervise every step she took.\n\nJehan is now working for the album, singing with three different groups and still writing songs of her own or for offered ocassions. Her group \"mellow trip trio\" which she regards as her lovely family!  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jehan+Barbur\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
