The band is led by Roberto Iniesta, also known as \"Robe\", or even \"El rey de Extremadura\" (the king of Extremadura).\n\nThe band was created in 1987 and is regarded as one of the most influential bands of the Spanish hard rock scene, besides being a complete symbol for their region. Iniesta's lyrics are often described as rude street poetry, with frequent allusions to drugs, love and self-destruction.\n\nThe band's name is a pun. Literally, Extremoduro means \"hard extreme\", and is also a straight-forward deformation of \"Extremadura\", the region where the band comes from.\n\nWell-known songs by Extremoduro include \"So payaso\", \"Golfa\", \"Salir\", \"Extremaydura\", \"Puta\" and \"Jesucristo García\". The highest moment in the band's career was probably reached with the release of their album Agíla, which was awarded a prize for best video in the first edition of the Spanish Music Adwards in 1996. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Extremoduro\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
