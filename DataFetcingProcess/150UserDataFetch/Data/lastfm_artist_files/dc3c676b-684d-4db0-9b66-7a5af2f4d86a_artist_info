Since the beginning of her music career in 2005, she collaborated with the Italian producer Lorenzo Montanà for the production of her albums. Together with Montanà, Tiffany started in 2011 the side project T.T.L. (Through the Lens) for creating instrumental music for soundtracks and trailers.\n\nTT released the studio albums Undercover (2005), Brain for Breakfast (2007), Peoples Temple (2010), Dark Days, White Nights (2012), and the EP One (2013). She also released the remix albums Black Neon Rmxs (2009) and Peoples Temple Remix Edition (2011).\n\nShe has always searched for a sincere and original approach to the various forms of art to which she has always been attracted. And for this reason she chose to attend the Art Institute which allowed her to experiment with various artistic paths from design and photography to performance art and music.\n\nIn the early years of her career she has traveled Europe as bass player and singer in various indie rock bands and she has acted in some independent movies, artistic films and theatrical performances.\n\nWith her first single \"You Know Me\", released by Get Physical (DJ T. & M.A.N.D.Y.) from Berlin, she is included in the compilation \"Full Body Workout vol 2\". The debut album Undercover (Jato Music) was released in 2005. Techno punk and hardcore rhythms and electro living together with the industrial past of TT, with her passion for post punk and dadaism. The record attracted great interest from critics and public.\n\nBrain for Breakfast follows released by the American label I Scream Records in 2007, an album of passage, rich with collaborations among those with Nic Endo and Pete Namlook. A tour sets off that winds through more than 200 dates throughout Europe in the best international clubs both for rock and electronic.\n\n2010 is the year of Peoples Temple (Trisol Records), album from the most dark shades, (as Fritz Lang’s Metropolis could also be defined as dark) in which TT moves with ease and originality. The title is an an explicit reference to the pseudo-religious cult led by Jim Jones who, on 18 November 1978, became the protagonist of the largest massacre of civilians from unnatural causes before 11 September. The event itself is a pretext that TT uses to broaden her point of view about today’s society, to the total lack of the lack of the ability to discriminate and prevailing ignorance. \n\nHer tour has never stopped between European clubs and festivals she opened for Iggy Pop, The Rapture, Eels, Austra, Stereo Total, Tiga, Deus and Alec Empire.\n\nHer fourth album, Dark Days, White Nights (Trisol Records 2012), was released in February 2012. The first single taken from the album, \"Drownin'\", had a premiere in October 2011, with its inclusion on the soundtrack of the popular videogame FIFA 12. \n\nIn Dark Days, White Nights TT offers a textbook lesson in post-punk attitude on a collision course with a wall of sound that refers to first wave of electronic, and strengthens, further, her reputation as an exceptional composer faithful to the roots of the genre. Decadence, alienation, sense of inadequacy, themes always dear to TT that are addressed in this album with light melancholy, harsh words entrusted to songs of extreme sweetness.\n\nIn the period that separated the last work Peoples Temple from the new Dark Days, White Nights, TT worked hard, enhancing her professional profile and qualifying herself as one of the most successful Italian projects abroad.\n\nThe song \"Storycide\" was chosen by CBS for \"Blood Moon\" episode No. 3 of the eleventh season of CSI: Las Vegas. TT composed the original music for the film trailers of \"Coriolanus\" directed by Ralph Fiennes and \"Hunger Games\" directed by Gary Ross based on the bestselling science fiction novel by Suzanne Collins which was released on 23 March 2012.\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Tiffany released the 4-track EP One on ZerOKilled Music.\n\n\nSites: official site at www.tyingtiffany.com | Facebook | Twitter | SoundCloud <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tying+Tiffany\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
