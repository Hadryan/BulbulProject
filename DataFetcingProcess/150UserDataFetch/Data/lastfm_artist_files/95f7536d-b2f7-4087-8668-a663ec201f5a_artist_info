The band members are Alexis Krauss (vocalist, lyricist) and Derek E. Miller (songwriter, guitarist, producer). Miller was formerly the guitarist for the hardcore band Poison the Well, and Krauss was a member of the teen pop group RubyBlue.\n\nIn 2008, Miller was waiting tables at a neighborhood Brazilian restaurant, Miss Favela, where he encountered Alexis and her mother. When he mentioned he was looking for a female vocalist to work with on a musical project, Krauss' mother immediately volunteered her. After steadily gaining popularity throughout 2009, Sleigh Bells signed to M.I.A.'s label N.E.E.T. in Spring 2010.\n\nThe duo released the 7-track EP Sleigh Bells. The EP received much attention and all but the last two tracks were re-recorded for their debut album.\n\nSleigh Bells issued the single \"Tell 'Em\" as a free download in April 2010. On 11 May 2010, they released their debut full-length album entitled Treats. Amidst blown-out drum beats, fuzzed guitars and synth-pop sensibilities, Krauss balances each song with a voice that is both forceful and elegant. Four other singles supported the album: \"Crown on the Ground\", \"Infinity Guitars\", \"Rill Rill\" and \"Riot Rhythm\".\n\nSleigh Bells began recording songs for their second studio album in June 2011. Describing the sound of the new album, Krauss said, \"It sounds really huge, so there's going to still be tons of volume\".\n\nOn 15 December 2011, the band released the single \"Born To Lose\", followed in January 2012 by \"Comeback Kid\". The second album, Reign of Terror, was released on 21 February 2012.\n\n\nOfficial site: http://reignofterror.tv <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sleigh+Bells\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
