unconsciousness or otherworldly space... some kind of waking dream\" Decoder Magazine\n\nBased around the acoustic guitar, Gareth Dickson's songs employ analogue delay and reverb in an attempt to recreate something of the modern ambient/electronic musical landscape as well as referencing some of the well known fingerpickers of the past. Sometimes entirely instrumental, sometimes with sparing vocals, always with the idea of exploring and finding new possibilities for an age old instrument.\n\n\"Where Dickson excels is with his unique use of the guitar as a sound making body. A glorious object in which to explore rich landscapes and acoustic ambience. This is beautiful music, music in the act of levitation, a ghostly presence; almost tangible but never within reach.\" Mark Harwood, Fire Records.\n\nHe has toured extensively as Vashti Bunyanâ€™s guitarist after she heard his music on the FatCat Records website. He has recorded and toured as a solo artist with Juana Molina. Along the way he has worked with many well respected pioneering musicians from this generation and previous, including Devendra Banhart, Coco Rosie, Max Richter, David Byrne and Joe Boyd (producer of Nick Drake, The Incredible String Band etc).\n\nHis first full-length release, Collected Recordings (2009, Drifting Falling) made the top 10 in a number of best of year lists. In 2010 The Dance was released, marking a shift towards the more experimental and again gaining some great reviews from some of the more respected review sites such as Fluid Radio and Textura. 2012 saw the next step in the discography, as well as some long awaited recognition of the previous work, with a release on New York label 12k.\n\nhttp://www.garethdickson.co.uk/\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gareth+Dickson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
