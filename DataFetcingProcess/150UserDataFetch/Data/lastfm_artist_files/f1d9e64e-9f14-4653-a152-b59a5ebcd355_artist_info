In 2006, last line-up arose with the joining of Emre Yılmaztürk(?2004,bassist) and Eren Parlakgümüs (2006,lead guitarist) to the main staff. \n\nZakkum[Raindog] released their first album “Zehr-i Zakkum” in January, 2007, after a long period of time and a result of a particular work. Producing, Mastering-Mix and Arrangement labours of this album are performed by Volkan Başaran, who is one of the most respected and influential musicians of Turkish Rock Music Industry. (by means of his such beyond skills, he may also be named as a jedi master or a Multimedia instrument,an intel centrino core 2 duo...) \n\nAlbum consists of 12 tracks,3 duets[Seyyal Taner, Zeynep Kaya(Fungu), Teoman] and is recorded at Raks Marsandiz Studios. All the lyrics are written by Cem Senyücel, compositions by Yusuf Demirkol and Eren Parlakgümüs. Music Video of the lead single ”Ah Çikolata” directed by Murat Kücük,has already started circulating on Turkish music channels.\n\nZakkum's unique style among its compeers,interesting interpretation and strong musical background seems to project their way to a wide success. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zakkum\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
