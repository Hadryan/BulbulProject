Since 1999 his most widely distributed and eclectic music has been released under the name of The Flashbulb, whose songs mostly fall under the IDM/breakcore genre. Other names Benn operates under are Benn Jordan, Q-Bit, Flexe, Dr. Lefty, Acidwolf, Human Action Network, DJ ASCII, Lucid32, Dysrhythmia, CHR15TPUNCH3R, Sixty Six Ex, and rnd16.\n\nBorn in 1978 and raised in the sketchy Ashburn district of South Chicago, Benn Jordan began playing jazz-influenced guitar before reaching the age of attending school. Without any proper musical training, his awkward style of inverted guitar playing and composition knew few restrictions and eventually panned out into full blown albums recorded on tape machines in his bedroom in the mid 1990’s. Being a one man band, Jordan grew quite fond of electronic instruments, which for a period of a few years dominated his compositions as he gained worldwide notoriety as an avant-garde electronic musician using the name “The Flashbulb”.\n\nIn more recent years (and 30-something album releases later), Jordan has focused his efforts on writing more cinematic pieces and using an instrumental style closer to his roots. On the other side of releasing music and touring, Jordan has become a sought after film and television composer, most notably writing for Dove’s viral “Evolution” campaign, and branding trademark melodies for companies such as General Mills and Toyota. These two worlds have merged in his hugely successful album “Soundtrack To A Vacant Life”, which is one of the first albums in the genre of cinematic music to receive mainstream attention without being attached to a feature film.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Flashbulb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
