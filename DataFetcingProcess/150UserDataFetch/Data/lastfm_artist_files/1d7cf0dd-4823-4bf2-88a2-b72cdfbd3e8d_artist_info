He is mainly a storyteller, using almost all kinds of popular music styles. As a professional bass player he performs in mostly electronic, groove oriented and free jazz styles... He is also author of a strange music philosophy book named \"Wolpadinga\". He has been and still is one of the most influential figures in Istanbul's modern music scene, both in Rock and modern Jazz.\n\nSongwriter-wise he preferes not to favor a distinct musical style and sound approach. Lyrically the themes he's chosen ranges from love and faith to more aggressive dreams (nightmares). \n\nMaybe not stylisticly but philosophically his approach might be called under the influence of Frank Zappa. Bass style resembles Bill Laswell. As an established studio musician and a sight reader he's played on numerous albums aswell. An alumnus of Berklee College of Music, Music Production and Sound Engineering.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Demirhan+Baylan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
