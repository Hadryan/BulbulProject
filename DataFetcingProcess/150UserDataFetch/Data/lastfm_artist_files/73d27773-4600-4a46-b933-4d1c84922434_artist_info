He started working as Machinefabriek in 2004. The name (meaning ‘machine factory’) was on the façade of a building Rutger passed everytime he went shopping for groceries. Except for a few piano and guitar lessons when he was young, Rutger didn’t study music. Instead, he graduated as a graphic designer. The sleeves of his releases are practically always designer by Rutger himself, being a crucial part of the music.\n \nMachinefabriek’s music combines elements of ambient, modern classical, minimalism, drone and field recordings. His pieces unfold as ‘films without image’, with a sharp ear for detail. After releasing a series of self released CD-Rs, the official debut, ‘Marijn’, was issued by Lampse in 2006. Since then a solid stream of singles and albums was released on labels like Type, 12K, Spekk, Dekorder, Digitalis, Experimedia and Staalplaat.\n\nPerforming live has been an important expression for Machinefabriek. He took his gear to Russia, Israel, Japan, Canada, Switserland, Spain, Chech Republic, Germany, Turkey and England. \nRutger collaborated (on record and/or live) with numerous artists, such as Ralph Steinbrüchel,\nAaron Martin, Peter Broderick, Frans de Waard, Wouter van Veldhoven, Simon Nabatov, Xela, Simon Scott, Steve Roden, Gareth Davis and Tim Caitlin amongst others.\n\nRutger also works with various visual artists. He scored music for dance pieces, films, video installations and sculptures. These cross-disciplinary collaborations are something Machinefabriek will focuss on more and more.\n\nContact Rutger at post@machinefabriek.nu Or check his website www.machinefabriek.nu <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Machinefabriek\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
