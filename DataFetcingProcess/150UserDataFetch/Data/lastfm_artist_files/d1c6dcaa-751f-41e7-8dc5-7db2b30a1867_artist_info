However, he gradually lost interest after he started taking lessons. Instead, he became fascinated with electronic sounds and science fiction, and grew up listening to Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream.\n\nBy the time Ilar was a teenager, he spent most of his time playing with synthesizers, sequencers and drum machines, resulting in an almost endless amount of tracks recorded on tape. Never feeling really satisfied with the quality of his productions, he decided to take a break in 1997.\n\nAfter some time, Ilar was introduced to a new way of producing music — computer software. After making a few tracks, he decided to start producing again. He got in contact with the German label Plong!, and was able to make his first official release. Since then, his output has spanned over many electronic styles — from the dubwise techno explorations for Echochord, via the blissful ambience of \"Everdom\", through to the deeper abstractions of his Audio.nl pieces, and on to the recent darkside acid techno on DSP and Narita.\n\nIlar now lives in Gothenburg on the Swedish West Coast. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anders+Ilar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
