Through his very own style as a producer he caused a stir outside of switzerland too and through his release on the well-known Perlon label he gained attention by many. The feedback on \"Hühnerfest\" the follow-up of \"Chicken Fried Rice\" became even better. DJs like Laurent Garnier, Luke Solomon and Rainer Trüby didn't stop spinning this true disco-funk-stomper that was produced together with a brass orchestra. SAchas Debut Album \"Rumpelzirkus\"is a great piece of music, made for the morning after and after everything. It’s an album like the sunrise after a long night out in the clubs. It rumbles and works the funk organically and songorientated. Kalabreses Rumpelzirkus (rumbling circus) goes on tour after album release with a band setup. check www.philipsherburn.com: great Album-Review-Blog.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kalabrese\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
