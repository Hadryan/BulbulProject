Working with fellow Stiffed member John Hill as co-producer, she recorded her debut album, Santogold, which was released in April 2008. Upon the change of her stage name, her label Downtown Records issued this press release:\n\n\"Change the graffiti on the bathroom wall, get your tattoo fixed, get your T-shirt airbrushed and change the name on your year-end list: Santogold is now Santigold. She's not telling you why, that's just how it is.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Santigold\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
