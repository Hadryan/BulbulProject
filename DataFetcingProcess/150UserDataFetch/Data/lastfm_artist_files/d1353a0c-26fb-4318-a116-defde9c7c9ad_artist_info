She lived with her poet mother and publisher father in London. \n\nOne day she looked up the story of her first name. \"I thought it was strange that I was called after a woman who killed herself in ancient literature. It's great for me now but there's no denying that I hated it. That was just another thing that made me stand out.\"\n\nYoung Dido enjoyed reading and playing tennis against the garden wall; when she was just 6, she was accepted into the Guildhall School of Music in London. By 10 she could play the piano, violin and recorder.\n\nSome of her teenage years were spent touring the UK with a Classical Ensemble and waitressing at Cafe Flo in Islington. She left school to pay her way through university, and eventually enrolled as a law student at Birkbeck University.\n\nAt 16 she became enthralled with the music of jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald and her brother's music collection.\n\nHer brother, Rollo, plays in the group Faithless and she featured on the group's five million selling debut album Reverence in 1995 on the tracks Flowerstand Man which she co-wrote and Salva Mea. Dido later featured on another Faithless album Sunday 8pm in 1998 on the tracks Postcards and Hem of his Garment which she co-wrote.\n\nIn between recording those two albums Dido met producer Clive Davis in 1997 after he had heard demos of some of her own tracks. \n\nDido was later signed to the record company Arista and began recording her debut album No Angel.\nThe album was released in the USA in 1999 and about a year later in October 2000 in the UK. Two tracks off the album have featured in a TV show and in a film. Thank You appeared in the film 'Sliding Doors' and Here With Me was the theme tune to 'Roswell' a hit TV show in the USA and which has been doing well in the UK.\n\nHer brother Rollo then did a solo project under the name Dusted, for which Dido co-wrote the tracks Always Remember To Respect & Honour Your Mother (Part 1) and Biggest Fool In The World, she  features on the tracks Time Takes Time and Hurt U and she co-wrote and features on the track Winter. The album was re-released in 2005 having been completely re-worked, sounding bigger and better.\n\nDido really shot to fame when Eminem incorporated Thank You into the massive number 1 hit Stan. For the 'Stan' video Dido agreed to wear a padded pregnancy suit and lie in the boot of a car before being dumped in a river. \"I did that for an adventure and a laugh. I'd just done a really glammy video for 'Here With Me' and suddenly I was on set choosing boxer shorts with Dr Dre while wearing this massive bump. I looked so pregnant I had to jump about on a sofa to flatten my stomach down.\" Dido said of Eminem \"He's been nothing but properly nice to me. He's polite, funny and charming, nothing like his media image at all. If he was such an arsehole I wouldn't have played with him, would I? I had no contract to do that. I chose to.\"\n\nA special edition of 'No Angel' was released in January 2001 with enhanced videos of 'Here With Me' and 'Thank You'. It also included a bonus track Take My hand and a picture gallery. The album went to number 1 and stayed there for a number of weeks. It has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. Her debut single Here With Me was released in February 2001 and became a hit getting to number 4.
