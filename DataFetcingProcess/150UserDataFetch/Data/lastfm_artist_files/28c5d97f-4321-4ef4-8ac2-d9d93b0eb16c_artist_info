With their unique blending of punk, electronica and surf music performed with a large amount of energy in visually exciting live shows they quickly gained an audience.\nMan or Astro-Man? crash landed in Auburn, Alabama, USA in 1992. They are known to play some of the most pristinely crafted surf instrumentals since the 1960s. Formed by CoCo the Electronic Monkey Wizard on alternate universe bass, Birdstuff on traps, Star Crunch on guitar, and Dr. Delecto & his Invisible Vaportron on bass, the group released their first full-length album, Is it...Man or Astro-Man?, in 1993. The band found time to put out a new 45 record practically every other week in addition to full-length releases like 1994's Destroy All Astromen!, 1996's Experiment Zero and 1999's Eeviac. The themes of the tunes usually run the gamut from spies to sci-fi. Dexter X later replaced Dr. Delecto, and Starcrunch left the band as well. The collection, Beyond the Black Hole, was issued in summer 2001 and featured three brand new tracks. In 2001, the band started an extensive hiatus.  In 2006 they performed at the Touch n Go 25th Anniversary fest.  In 2010 they announced that they will be reuniting for a few gigs, including SXSW, and possibly to record a new record.\n2013 has seen the band release a new set of 7 inch singles and a brand new album, Defcon54321, through the Georgia-based indie magazine, The Chunklet. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Man+or+Astro-Man%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
