When they began looking for a vocalist they discovered Hennessey's then girlfriend Jessie Banks, could sing. The band spent some time writing music and demoing songs and eventually demos made their way to Japan. A Tokyo DJ cut some of their demo CD onto 12\" records and one of those records landed in the hands of the owner of Tummy Touch Records with the Japanese label reading \"beautiful Chungking music\" (Where the band eventually got its name). He tracked the band down and talked the into finishing their album. Their first album We Travel Fast was released on Tummy Touch records in 2003.\n\nChungking released The Hungry Years  - mainly featuring tracks from We Travel Fast remixed and with bigger arrangements - on Gut records in Nov 2004. \n\nRecently, a track called Following (from \"The Hungry Years\") became quite popular after being featured on a soundtrack of the popular TV show Nip/Tuck.\n\nIn the depths of Brighton, Chungking have been locked away for the best part of 2005 and 2006 recording their new album, 'Stay Up Forever.'  It's mostly a more uptempo affair - but includes several of Chungking's trademark lush ballads - and includes production contributions from pop maverick Richard X.  It is due for release on Gut sub label Gifted in March 2007 - a single 'Slow It Down' will precede it. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chungking\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
