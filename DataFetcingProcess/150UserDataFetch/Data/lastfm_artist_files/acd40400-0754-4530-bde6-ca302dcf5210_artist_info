He was quickly noticed by the youth in town. After returning to Turkey, he composed music for plays, films and commercials. He played on the same stage as international musicians such as Plaid, Mouse on Mars, The Orb and Chemical Brothers. Deniz Cuylan, on the other hand, is known for his project Maya whose album Telecine was released in 2003. He played his groovy electronica-jazz fusion in many popular venues in Turkey and abroad. He composed music for tv shows, films, commercials as well as fashion shows that took place in Düsseldorf and Moscow. He released his solo album Netame in 2004. The album also had an illustrations book by Sadi Güran. Deniz still hosts a radio program called Tirtillar and he is the editor of an alternative lifestyle-music magazine called Bant.
