He was born in Frankfurt, Germany but lived with his family in Algeria from the age of 7 to 12 and went to a French primary school. Müller came back to Frankfurt with his family in 1983 and went to school where he made a lot of spelling mistakes. Around that time his parents bought an organ for Christmas and he tried to do some synth-pop with a school friend. They decided to buy a synthesizer and a drumcomputer.\nRajko was bored by synth-pop and ebm in the end of the eighties and listened more to rock and independent. Friends made him discover house-music, hip-hop and techno in the early 90ies. He restarted to copy this on his old synthesizer and soon realized the need of more equipment, that was already bought by his older brother because he liked electronic music, too.\nHe gave a tape to his friend DJ Andreas Baumecker who worked in a record-store where the Playhouse guys used to work, too. \n\nIn 1998, Isolée achieved a timeless stroke of genius with the seminal “Beau Mot Plage” (Playhouse), which enchanted listeners across genres and the world, pushing the boundaries of electronic dance music further than they’d ever been pushed before. This was followed by two highly acclaimed albums on Frankfurt label Playhouse, Rest and  We Are Monster, along with numerous remixes for artists like Recloose, Blaze, Franz Ferdinand, Roy Davis Jr., Tiga, Alter Ego and International Pony, to name a few.\n\nAfter six years, Isolée released his third album on Pampa Records.  Well Spent Youth, released on February 7th, 2011 once again showcases Rajko Müller’s talent as an exceptionally visionary producer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Isol%C3%A9e\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
