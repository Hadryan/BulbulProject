They are not to be confused with Electro Shock Therapy or an Italian band EST, which has an album listed here: Mostrati. \n\ne.s.t were renowned for their vibrant style - playing in rock venues to young crowds. They achieved great commercial success and critical acclaim throughout Europe. Their 1999 release \"From Gagarin's Point of View\" started their international breakthrough, being the first e.s.t. album to be released outside of Scandinavia through the German label ACT. The group was the first — and still the only — European Group to appear on the cover of Downbeat Magazine.\n\nEsbjörn Svensson tragically died after a diving accident in Sweden on June 14, 2008. He was 44 years old.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996 Esbjörn Svensson was awarded Swedish Jazz Musician of the Year and 1998 Songwriter of the Year, and the 1997 release \"Winter in Venice\" – consisting mainly of original material – was awarded the Swedish Grammy. \"Strange Place For Snow\", E.S.T.'s 2002 release earned numerous awards including the Jahrespreis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik (from the German Phonoacademy), the German Jazz Award, Choc de l'année (Jazzman, France), the Victoire du Jazz – the French Grammy – as best international act and also the Revelation of the Festival award, a special award from Midem. In December 2004, E.S.T. were awarded the Hans Koller prize as European Artist of the Year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Esbj%C3%B6rn+Svensson+Trio\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
