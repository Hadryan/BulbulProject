It's dark and extreme, influenced by existentialism and avant-garde/radical/underground currents. The group has a reputation for unrelenting live shows that are a full-on assault of the senses,whilst achieving even greater depth on their debut album. Led by Zack Sarzana's gliding guitars and vocal stylings that range from soft and hazy to outright threatening. The December Sound creates a feeling of hollowed reverberations, echoing trough the air. Jimmy Rossi Jr. joins in creating this vicious soundscapes with dreamy keyboards and melodic rhythm guitar that often calls back to Zack's leads. Keeping the back-beat going is the hypnotic ryhtym section which includes the spiral-like drumming of Drew Richards, along with newest member Cat Crowley, delicately playing a bass that hums chaos. The December Sound's The Silver Album album is filled with drones and tones of dark, profound sonic depth. Already being heralded as \"the best unsigned band on the planet!\" by the 'The Big Takeover', their debut effort certainly lives up that praise.\n\nhttp://thedecembersound.bandcamp.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+December+Sound\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
