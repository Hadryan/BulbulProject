Her collaborators range from the Sneaker Pimps to Mr Lif (Thievery Corporation), Jon Auer (The Posies), and Yppah (Ninja Tune), and she has toured with Tricky, Little Dragon, The Album Leaf, and Bajofondo. Her music has been featured in film, television and videogames, from Xbox’s Alan Wake to MTV’s Jersey Shore and Showtime’s United States of Tara. Anomie is a multi-instrumentalist, film composer, producer and vocalist from Seattle. \n\nThe themes of her music are fit for her moniker. “I chose the alias ‘Anomie Belle’ to speak to the decadent alienation of the American dream,” she explains. “I am perplexed by the ways that, though we may be critical of them, we are still shaped by and complicit in the perpetuation of oppressive, unjust, and unsustainable ideologies and ways of life that driven not by values and ethics, but by profit and power.”\n\n***\n\n“Anomie Belle has proven herself to be a legitimate quintuple threat as a masterful composer, producer, programmer, vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist. Her sultry, smoky vocals combine with her slithery, seductive programming for the perfect balance of sexiness and darkness. Anomie Belle is poised to find herself among the most revered names of the genre” - URB Magazine\n\n“Anomie Belle is a gorgeous curio of the Seattle scene with her Sia meets Portishead meets Björk sound - otherworldly music that transports me from my own skin to somewhere other than here. Featuring classical composition as a foundation, the Oregon native layers everything from violins to electric guitar to glitchy bleeps under a vocal style that vacillates between neo-soul and something more dramatic.” - 303 Magazine\n\n“Anomie Belle broke onto the scene in 2008 to rave reviews. [She] is a classically trained violinist, and approaches drums, synths and guitars with similar attention to detail. [How Can I Be Sure] is looped and layered delicately, swirling soulful vocals together with percussion that carries a moody sadness.” - Tom Tom Magazine\n\n“She sings with such soul, it is difficult not to be captivated. Her voice is a perfect marriage of Beth Gibbons and Amy Winehouse. In fact, Belle nearly manages to convey the pain of emotional desolation on par with the aforementioned musicians. Along with the downtempo structure, her carefully restrained vibrato, and the dreamy backing ambiance, [Slither] is not one to be missed for those familiar with trip hop and minimalism.” - In Your Speakers\n\n“Anomie Belle is a musical mastermind, creating layered, ethereal music completely on her own. The beauty is in the layering of electronic and acoustic instruments, weaving an engrossing musical tapestry. How Can I Be Sure is a four-song EP by the Seattle-based multi-instrumentalist. Belle is in complete control of her music, handling all the performing as well as the recording and engineering. Her Renaissance woman take is so refreshing in this day and age of auto-tuned singers dominating the music charts.” - Innocent Words Magazine\n\n“Her voice is very rich, very distinctive, very soulful at times, and once heard, easily identifiable (and no, I don‘t mean it sounds exactly like Bjork, it sounds like Belle). Her playful use of electronics accentuates her lyrics and vocal stylings, rather than rigid songs with words spat out over the top. The tracks seem very organic, and quite unlike anything I’ve heard recently.” - Release Magazine\n\n“She combines electronic and experimental elements with sensual beats, lush strings and layered vocals, dropping the listener into the melancholy heart of her beautiful symphonies. Anomie Belle will dissolve you.” - Performer Magazine\n\nFree tracks can be downloaded from her official website, www.anomiebelle.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anomie+Belle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
