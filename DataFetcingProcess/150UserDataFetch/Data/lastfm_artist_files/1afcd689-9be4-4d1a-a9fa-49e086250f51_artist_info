Both bands were created by Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha. The music heard on Metalocalypse is performed by Brendon Small, with others as needed.\n\nIn the Metalocalypse series, Dethklok is depicted as an extremely popular and successful death metal band.

With their widespread commercial success and lucrative sponsorship contracts, Dethklok is ranked as the world's seventh largest economy by the end of the second season.\n\nThe members of Dethklok are often portrayed as incompetent at almost everything not related to their profession. The band struggles to perform everyday tasks, including shopping for groceries, preparing food, and maintaining proper social relationships. They are often assisted by their manager and lawyer, Charles Foster Ofdensen, who frequently attempts to prevent the band from making poor decisions. The band's actions and uncanny misfortune have caught the attention of an Illuminati-style council, known as The Tribunal. The Tribunal is portrayed as Dethklok's antagonist throughout the series, and secretly monitors their actions in almost every episode. They describe Dethklok as the \"world's greatest cultural force.\" The leader of The Tribunal (Mr. Selatcia), however, frequently instructs the other members to allow Dethklok to do as they will.\n\nThe on show members of Dethklok are:\nNathan Explosion - Vocals\nSkwisgaar Skwigelf - Lead Guitar\nToki Wartooth - Rhythm Guitar\nWilliam Murderface - Bass\nPickles - The Drummer\n\nThe real life preformers\nBrendon Small – vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards\nGene Hoglan – drums (2007–present)\nBryan Beller – bass (2012–present)\n\nLive - with addition to / replace of  \nMike Keneally – guitar, backing vocals\nPete Griffin – bass (2012)\n\nMordhaus, United States <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dethklok\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
