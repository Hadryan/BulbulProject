He performed vocals for the track Lonely Soul on UNKLE's 1998 release Psyence Fiction and his voice can also be heard on the The Chemical Brothers' album Come With Us track The Test.\n\nHe is good friends with Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and Coldplay's Chris Martin (whom Ashcroft thanks for 'letting me be myself again'), and occasionally plays as support at Oasis and Coldplay concerts, including the European and second UK legs of Coldplay's 'Twisted Logic Tour'. He recently described himself as 'the best support act you'll ever see'. The Oasis track \"Cast No Shadow\" is dedicated to him. Chris Martin introduced him as \"the best singer in the world\" when he performed \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" (which Martin called \"the best song in the world\") with Coldplay at the London Live 8 concert in 2005. On his second album Human Conditions The Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson guest stars on the song Nature is the Law.\n\nAshcroft is married to Kate Radley, ex-Spiritualized keyboard player.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Ashcroft\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
