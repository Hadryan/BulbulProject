It was formed by Piet Sielck (ex-Savage Circus), Kai Hansen (ex-Helloween, Gamma Ray), Thomas 'Thomen' Stauch (ex-Blind Guardian,Savage Circus). Both Sielck and Hansen handled lead vocal duties, Sielck doing the most parts and was also the lower voice and Hansen the higher and sang occasionally.\n\nThe band has a science-fiction theme to their writing. Most of their songs narrate an elaborate story based on a plot involving a self-aware space vessel (the Iron Savior) constructed by the lost continent of Atlantis. Recently, themes include explorations on one's perception of reality and the spirit of freedom. Their style may appeal to fans of Iron Maiden, Gamma Ray and Helloween, among others.\n\nAlbum releases include:\n*Iron Savior (1997)\n*Unification - 1998)\n*Interlude (EP) (1999)\n*Dark Assault (2001)\n*Condition Red (2002)\n*Battering Ram (2004)\n*Megatropolis (2007)\n*The Landing (2011)\n*Rise of the Hero (2014)\n*Megatropolis 2.0 (2015)\n\nMany of their albums include a cover song, given new life through typical Iron Savior style. Iron Savior has done covers of Seal, Judas Priest, Helloween, and Black Sabbath to name a few.\n\nCurrent lineup:\n*Piet Sielck (guitars, lead vocals)\n*Joachim Küstner (guitars, back vocals)\n*Yenz Leonhardt (bass, back vocals)\n*Thomas Nack (drums)\n\nEx-members\n*Kai Hansen (guitars, lead vocals, back vocals)\n*Thomas 'Thomen' Stauch (drums)\n*Dan Zimmermann (drums)\n*Jan-Sören Eckert (bass, vocals)\n*Andreas Kück (keyboards, back vocals)\n\nOfficial website: http://www.iron-savior.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Savior\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
