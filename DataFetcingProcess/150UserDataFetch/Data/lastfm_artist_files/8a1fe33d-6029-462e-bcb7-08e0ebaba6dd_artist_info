Tasty Fish was the first release in 1991, and was a hit in the club scene. In 1993, the single Selfish was printed and again had much fanfare but promise of the first album seemed to be a goal that was kept out of reach; largely due to the failing of their label Factory Records, creative control issues and red tape. In November of 1993, The Other Two & You finally saw the light of day.\n\nDuring the next few years, the duo also did music work for a number of television shows such as America's Most Wanted, Making Out, and Cold Feet.  In 1999, another album entitled Super Highways was released but again the band was under promoted by its label, and the album was never released in the USA. The two standout singles were Super Highways and You Can Fly.\n\nNew Order reformed in 1998 with both Morris and Gilbert in the lineup. Gilbert left New Order in 2001 to care for her and Morris' ill daughter. The Other Two has ceased releasing material under their group name although both Morris and Gilbert produce thematic music for television soundtracks to this date. The pair most recently contributed two remixes to the Nine Inch Nails album Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D in 2007.\n\nThe band has announced intent to release new material for purchase via the internet in 2011.
