Ritter is known for his distinctive Americana style and narrative lyrics. In 2006 he was named one of the \"100 Greatest Living Songwriters\" by Paste magazine.\n\nBorn to two neuroscientists, Ritter bought his first guitar from the local K-MART after hearing the Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash classic Girl From The North Country. He started at Oberlin College with the intent to follow in his parents' scientist footsteps, but instead discovered songwriting, and the music of artists like Gillian Welch, Townes Van Zandt, and Leonard Cohen. He graduated and then moved east, favoring its close proximity to historic folk clubs such as \"Club Passim\" in Boston. On a shoestring budget he recorded his critically acclaimed breakthrough album Golden Age of Radio in 2002 at various tiny, one-room studios on the East Coast. He has continued to grow from there, further developing his sound on subsequent albums.\n\nJosh has recorded several records and E.P.s. In chronological order, they are:\n\nJosh Ritter (Self Titled) (2000)\nGolden Age of Radio (2001)\nCome and Find Me EP (2003)\nHello Starling (2003)\n4 Songs Live E.P. (2005)\nThe Animal Years (2006)\nGirl In The War E.P. (2006)\nGood Man E.P.
