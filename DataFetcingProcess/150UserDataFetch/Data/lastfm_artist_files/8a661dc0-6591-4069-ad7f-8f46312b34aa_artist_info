Fronted by his wife, Juliette, who has been described as a cross between Billie Holiday, Beth Gibbons and Jessica Rabbit, 8MM quickly became a local underground buzz. Internet word-of-mouth led to tremendous organic support followed by global critical acclaim from artists and tastemakers such as the influential Nic Harcourt of KCRW.\n\nAs a producer and mixer, Beavan has worked with a cadre of seminal artists including Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Depeche Mode, No Doubt, System of a Down and Slayer (amongst many others). \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/8mm\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
