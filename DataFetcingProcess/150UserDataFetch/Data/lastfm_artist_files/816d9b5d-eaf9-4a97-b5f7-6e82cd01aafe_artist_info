He suffered a stroke in 2003, from which he never really recovered, and died in 2005.\n\nDuring his career, he sold 25 million albums and won eight Grammy awards including Best Male R&B Vocal Performance four times. He won four Grammy awards in 2004, including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the track \"Dance With My Father,\" co-written with Richard Marx.\n\n  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Luther+Vandross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
