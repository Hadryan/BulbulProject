He began his musical studies with his father, Rafael Romero. In 1941 moved to Caracas and worked as pianist in nocturnal saloons and dance orchestras. In 1949 toured in Cuba, and then to New York. In 1952 returned to Caracas and established his own dance orchestra. In 1951 signed contract with RCA Victor to record with a full orchestra, what was to be a very successful album in the \"Dinner In...\" series, featuring popular Latin American music. Under the RCA label he published his LP Dinner in Caracas, with which beat all sales records in South America until then. Afterwards, recorded numerous LP albums in different countries. In America, his ability as arranger/conductor led him to collaborate with popular orchestras and singers, such as Dean Martin, Jerry Lee Lewis, Stan Kenton, Machito and Tito Puente, between others. He also toured extensively, performing in numerous countries: Mexico, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, France, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, Russia, Egypt and Japan.\n\nRomero was the creator of a new form of Venezuelan music, known as \"New Wave\" (Onda Nueva), derived from the joropo and influenced by Brazilian Bossa Nova. He also had an important role in the field of learned music. In 1979 founded the Caracas Philarmonic Orchestra, of which he was the first Conductor. He also conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Romanian Radio/TV and the Royal Philarmonic Orchestra. He was the father of Aldemaro Romero, Jr., who is a renowned biologist in the United States and a leader in Cave fish and Marine Mammal research.\n\nAwards\nIn 1969 Romero received the Peace Prize of the Soviet Intellectuals, in the Moscow Cinema Festival for his soundtrack music for the Simón Bolivar epic film. He also obtained the first prize as composer and conductor at Majorca Palms Festival, the Olympic Games Musical Festival in Greece; and in the Latin Song Festival of Mexico. For his extensive work, he received numerous recognitions in his country, being awarded with the Andrés Bello, Diego de Losada, Francisco de Miranda and the Work Merit orders, all in their first class, granted by the Venezuelan Government to political, artistic and social outstanding individuals. Then, in 2000 obtained the National Music Prize, and in 2006 the Honoris Causa degrees from the University of Carabobo and Lisandro Alvarado University of Barquisimeto.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldemaro_Romero\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aldemaro+Romero\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
