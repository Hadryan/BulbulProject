Portman was also nominated for Academy Awards for her scores for \"The Cider House Rules\" in 1999 and \"Chocolat\" in 2000.\n\nAn unused score of hers was composed for the film Dangerous Beauty (George Fenton replaced her, but some of her material still remains in the film). For television, she composed the score for all thirteen episodes of Jim Henson's The Storyteller and two episodes of The Jim Henson Hour (\"Monster Maker\" and \"Living with Dinosaurs\").\nHer other works include a children's opera, The Little Prince (which was later adapted for television) and Little House on the Prairie, a musical based upon the Laura Ingalls Wilder books Little House on the Prairie (2008). Portman was commissioned to write a piece of choral music for the BBC Proms series in August 2007.\n\nOn 19 May 2010, she was honored at the BMI Film & TV Awards with the Richard Kirk Award which is bestowed on composers who have made significant contributions to the realm of film and television music. Portman made BMI history as she became the first woman composer to receive the honor.\n\nPortman was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.rachelportman.co.uk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rachel+Portman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
