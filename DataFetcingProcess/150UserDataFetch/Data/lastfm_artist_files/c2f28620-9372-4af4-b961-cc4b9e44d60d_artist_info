As of late 2004, the band consists of Glen Hansard (vocals, guitar), Joe Doyle (bass guitar, vocals), Colm Mac Con Iomaire (violin, keyboard and vocals), Rob Bochnik (lead guitar), and Johnny Boyle (drums). On both versions of the album \"Fitzcarraldo\" the band went by the moniker \"The Frames DC\", to avoid being mistaken with a United States band of the same name.\n\nThe Frames have been together since 1990 and are a survivor of Dublin's prolific early 90's rock and roll scene. They have also been essential in the development of the current crop of emerging Irish rock bands, such as Turn. The Frames have toured with various other Irish artists, including Damien Rice and Bell X1. In December 2004, Hansard appeared on stage in a collaboration with singer songwriter Paddy Casey.\n\nThe name The Frames reportedly arose from Hansard's habit, at a young age, of fixing the bicycles of many of his friends. The large number of bicycle frames lying around his house led neighbours to dub it the \"house with the frames\".\n\nTheir new, 6th studio album, The Cost, is available in Ireland since 22 September 2006 and worldwide since 20 February 2007.\n\nLead singer Hansard recently collaborated with Czech musician Markéta Irglová, which led to the solo album \"The Swell Season\". Glen and Markéta also star and perform in the John Carney movie Once (www.oncethemovie.com).  The movie received several awards including the World Cinema Audience Award - Dramatic at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival as well as an Oscar for best Song for the track \"Falling Slowly\". \n\nOn several occasions the members of The frames appear on stage during the Swell season gigs.\n\nwww.theframes.ie\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Frames\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
