Despite roots dating back as far as 1978, Crime & the City Solution did not truly emerge until 1984, coming to life in the wake of the dissolution of the seminal Birthday Party. Crime & the City Solution had many members over the years, which can be divided into four distinct line-ups: Sydney in 1977-78, Melbourne in 1979, and two groupings in Berlin. The only common member in all four line-ups was Bonney.  For a complete list of the different line-ups see below.\n\nIn 1985, the quartet debuted on record for the first time with The Dangling Man E.P., a self-produced EP quickly establishing the band's moody, atmospheric blues-based aesthetic. Former Swell Maps drummer Epic Soundtracks joined Crime after the EP's release, freeing Harvey to alternate among a variety of instruments for the haunting follow-up, Just South of Heaven. Their full-length bow Room of Lights appeared in 1986 and featured the remarkable \"Six Bells Chime\", which so impressed acclaimed filmmaker Wim Wenders that he invited the band to perform the song live in his 1988 masterpiece Wings of Desire.\n\nBy the time the film appeared, however, the incarnation of Crime & the City Solution presented onscreen was no more; after Room of Lights, the Howard brothers and Soundtracks exited to form These Immortal Souls, leaving Bonney, Harvey and violinist Bronwyn Adams (also Bonney's wife and songwriting partner) to relocate to Berlin, where they recruited a number of local musicians, including Einst√ºrzende Neubauten guitarist Alexander Hacke, to cut 1988's ornate, intoxicating Shine.  Even more baroque was the follow-up, 1989's The Bride Ship.\n\nIn 1990, Crime returned to the studio one final time to record Paradise Discotheque, a record built around Bonney's ambitious four-part suite \"The Last Dictator\", a song cycle inspired by the downfall of Romanian warlord Nicolae Ceaucescu. After contributing \"The Adversary\" to the soundtrack of Wenders' Until the End of the World, Crime & the City Solution disbanded; while Harvey rejoined former Birthday Party mate Nick Cave in the Bad Seeds, Bonney began work on his 1992 solo debut, Forever.\n\nIn late 2011 the band's rebirth was declared, that resulted in a brand new album American Twilight released in 2013.\n\nBand Line-ups:\nSydney, 1977-1978\nSimon Bonney - vocals\nDon McLennan - drums\nHarry Zanteni - guitar\nPhil Kitchener - bass\nDave MacKinnon - soprano & tenor saxophone\n\nMelbourne, 1979\nSimon Bonney - vocals\nDon McLennan - drums\nDan Wallace-Crabbe - guitar\nLindsay O'Meara - bass\nChris Astley - keyboards\nKim Beissel - alto saxophone\n\nBerlin/London, 1985-1986\nSimon Bonney - vocals\nMick Harvey - guitar\nRowland S.
