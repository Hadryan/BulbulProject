The sound is a mix with folk, pop, electronic, with a sound that would be very much like if you threw The Postal Service, The Decemberists, The Flaming Lips, and George Orwell in a large blender.\n\nThey've recorded two albums and one EP under the Electric President moniker, all available under the German imprint Morr Music, with a third to be released in early 2010 on Fake Four Inc. They've had songs on television and in various short films. They both came from DIY ideas of making music, and as such record all their music in a tool shed and a bedroom with a handful of recording gear. Apparently, this gives them cred.\n\nThey hope to one day be incredibly rich from their music so they can buy an airplane and set it on fire without ever using it. To burn that sucker simply because they can, and to stand by and drink expensive wine and laugh manically until it explodes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Electric+President\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
