Her fame-criticizing lyrics, sparse production, and age of 16 all combined to make her a polarizing figure in the media.\n\nInitially, she was written off as a one hit wonder, but her top-ten second single Team, curation of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay soundtrack, and her friendship with other A-listers like Taylor Swift has kept her in the spotlight. Even as of 2016, Lorde’s Twitter account has over 4.29 million followers.\n\nDespite her alt-pop beginnings, though, Lorde isn't a hipster—pop culture fills her social media accounts. We can only wonder whether this will be an influence when her sophomore album is finally released. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lorde\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
