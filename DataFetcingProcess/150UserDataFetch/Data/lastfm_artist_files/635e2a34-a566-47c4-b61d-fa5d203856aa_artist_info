She released her first single, \"Haydi Şansım/Gel Bana\" (Come on My Luck/Come to Me) in 1975. However, she remained undiscovered until her 1976 single \"Olmaz Olsun\" reached number one in the Turkish charts. Her first album Serçe (Sparrow) appeared in 1978, which gave her also her nickname.\n\nIn the coming years, Aksu also acted in two films and opened a live music club in Istanbul. Her music throughout these years remained conventional, but melodic pop, perhaps best exemplified by \"Gülümse\" (Smile) of 1991.\n\nIn 1995, Aksu branched out with the experimental album Işık Doğudan Yükselir (Light from the East), drawing both on western classical and regional Turkish musical traditions. This album made her known outside Turkey and gave her a devoted world music following across Europe.\n\nShe has collaborated with many other musicians, such as Tarkan and Sertab Erener, resulting in continental hits such as \"Şımarık\".\n\n\nDiscography\n \nAllahaısmarladık (Good Bye) 1977 \nSerçe (Sparrow) 1978 \nSevgilerimle (With Love) 1980 \nAğlamak Güzeldir (To Cry is Beautiful) 1981 \nFiruze 1982 \nSen Ağlama (Don't Cry) 1984 \nGit (Go) 1986 \nSezen Aksu '88 1988 \nSezen Aksu Söylüyor (Sezen Aksu Sings) 1989 \nGülümse (Smile) 1991 \nDeli Kızın Türküsü (Crazy Girl's Ballad) 1993 \nIşık Doğudan Yükselir (Ex Oriente Lux / Light from the East) 1995 \nDüş Bahçeleri (Gardens of Dream) 1996 \nDüğün ve Cenaze (Wedding and Funeral) 1997 \nAdı Bende Saklı (His Name is Hidden In Me) 1998 \nDeliveren 2000 \nŞarkı Söylemek Lazım (Time to Sing) 2002\nYaz Bitmeden (Before The Summer Ends) 2003 \nBahane (Excuse) 2005 \nBahane Remixes (Excuse Remixes) 2005 \nKardelen (Snowdrop) 2005\nDeniz Yıldızı (Starfish) 2008\nYürüyorum Düş Bahçeleri'nde...
