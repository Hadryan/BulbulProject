The first release played and extended this theme of altering 1920s and 1930s ballroom music creating an eerie and haunted soundworld. Subsequently the sound has become darker and often more abstract over time, moving away from the initial idea of a haunted ballroom into territories involving the mind and its abilities to recall memories.\n\nCurrently The Caretaker is inspired by the topic of \"Amnesia\" and the brain's abilities to recall situations from the distant and immediate past. This work is best recalled in the monumental \"Theoretically pure anterograde amnesia\" release, a release which accurately echoes and recreates aurally the disease itself which is no mean achievement.\n\nThe Caretaker is building an ever expanding following for his audio memories. Fans of the darker isolationist ambient work of modern composers such as William Basinski, Nurse With Wound, Aphex Twin, Fennesz and Brian Eno would find elements to admire and enjoy and also parallels to The Caretaker's output. It can be a harsh world at times but ultimately exposure is always rewarding. Immerse yourself in the darkness and give into the spirits and tales recalled and retold in his unique way.\n\nhttp://www.brainwashed.com/vvm <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Caretaker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
