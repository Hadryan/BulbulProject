Her voice is often bathed in a wash of reverb and space echo and creates a ghostly, atmospheric feeling to the music. \n\nShe has American Gothic leanings; her songs often take place in an imagined, idealistic time with a cast of characters of her own creation. Her links to American Gothic are reinforced by Annabelle Lee, the last song on her debut album, Ballads of Living and Dying, which puts the poem of the same title by Edgar Allan Poe to a musical backing. Singing in a haunting mezzo-soprano, the foundation of her songs are her delicate 6-string acoustic guitar, often accompanied by variety of instruments, including electric guitar, theremin, and piano. Marissa Nadler is continuously thought of as a prolific and thoughtful musician, and it seems that a neverending flow of beautiful songs pours from her fingers and voice.\n\nOfficial Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Marissa-Nadler/300932499775\nBandcamp: http://marissanadler.bandcamp.com/\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marissa+Nadler\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
