After first emerging last year with sultry Summer reworkings of Bag Raiders’ “Turbo Love”, The Lowbrows’ “Dream In The Desert”, Toecutter’s “Best Party Ever”, The C90s “Shine a Light” and the duo truly came into their own when, at the behest of dance imprint Bang Gang 12s, they produced an original of their own. \n\nAt once a rapturous Summer anthem, late night soundtrack to the unravelling of your frontal lobe and subdued slow burner suited to doing nothing at all, the resulting track would be dubbed “Crave You”, the Aeroplane-approved breakout single. But this isn’t just your typical club banger, it’s far more languid than that, more refined. Think radiant dance pop infused with luscious keys, dusty beat work and the coquettish purr of Melbourne songwriter Giselle Rosselli  - all channelled through the slinky nonchalance of a sleepy-eyed lounge crooner. \nAside from fast becoming a club and festival circuit mainstay, “Crave You” would go on to draw significant radio airplay, remixes from the likes of Cassian, Graz and The C90s, a cover by Ted & Francis and even the praise of celebrity blogger Perez Hilton.  \nNow, thanks to Rhett Wade Ferrell of Melbourne’s Moopjaw collective (the production house responsible for recent music videos by Peaches, Neon Indian and The Golden Filter) one of the most infectious jams of 2010 now has a visual accompaniment. Things to note: Aside from being Flight Facilities’ debut music video, the New York shot clip also includes an appearance by fashion designer Christian Joy, best known as the dress dismantling costume designer for Yeah Yeah Yeah's frontwoman Karen O, as well as a striking transgender girl as the clip’s male protagonist & new york stunner Whitney Brown.\nFlight Facilities capped off their breakout year with a well-deserved SMAC Award nod for “Best Song of 2010”, a Kitsune Maison Release, and finish inside the top 20 tracks  on Australia's biggest radio poll; Triple Js Hottest 100 2010. Touring 35 shows across Europe, two japan tours and numerous festival slots with highlights playing Falls Festival to a 5000 strong crowd, Harbourlife, Summerdayze, Parklife and Shore Thing!\n\nFlight Facilities have also added Holy Ghost!, “Wait & See” & a beautiful summer vibe remix of Cut Copy's single Take me over to the their catalogue.\n\nThe new Flight Facilities single was released August 2011 named Foreign Language featuring new unknown vocalist Jess Higgs\n\nhttp://www.flightfacilities.com\nhttp://flightfacilities.com/blog\nhttp://soundcloud.com/flightfacilities <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Flight+Facilities\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
