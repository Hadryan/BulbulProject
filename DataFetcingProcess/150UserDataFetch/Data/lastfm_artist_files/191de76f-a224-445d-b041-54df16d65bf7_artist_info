The Yardbirds were a blues based band whose sound evolved into experimental pop rock, they had a string of hits including For Your Love, Over, Under, Sideways, Down and Heart Full of Soul. They were the crucial link between British Rhythm and Blues and psychedelia; they set the framework for heavy metal explored further by Led Zeppelin and the guitarists they spawned were extremely influential in music. They broke up in 1968.\nThey had a short but powerful appearance in the Antonioni movie 'Blow Up.' <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Yardbirds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
