It started as a duo in 2008 and became a solo project in 2011, when Jackson's songwriting and producing partner Ben Langmaid left the group. Her music is largely influenced by 80s pop music including Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, The Human League,  Heaven 17, Yazoo and Prince.\n\nThe name La Roux (pronounced lah-roo) is reported to be chosen when Elly found it in a book of baby names. La Roux comes from the mix of the French masculine word for \"redhead\" and the feminine article for \"the\", referring to Jackson's distinctive hairstyle.\n\nIn 2006 Jackson and Langmaid were introduced by a mutual friend. Their first project was named Automan and they wrote largely acoustic music.\n\nIn 15 December 2008, La Roux released their first single \"Quicksand\" on Kitsun√© Music label, reaching just #129 on UK. This single was followed on 29 June 2009 by their debut album La Roux on Polydor label. The album peaked at #2 on UK albums chart, #158 on US charts, and it sold over 500,000 copies worldwide.\n\nLa Roux' second single \"In For the Kill\" was released on 16 March 2009. This single debuted at #11 on the UK singles chart and peaked at #2. The dubstep producer Skream made two remixes of this track: \"In for the Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey remix)\" and \"In for the Kill (That Doesn't Sound Like Skream's remix)\". Lifelike also made a remix entitled \"In for the Kill (Lifelike Remix)\".\n\n\"Bulletproof\" was released on 22 June 2009 and debuted at #1 on the UK singles chart and peaked at #8 on the US charts. This single was ranked #25 on Rolling Stone's list of The 25 Best Songs of 2009. They issued \"I'm Not Your Toy\" as fourth single on 27 September 2009, reaching #27 on the UK singles chart.\n\nLa Roux gained fifth position on the BBC's Sound of 2009 poll. The Guardian featured La Roux as one of the \"Best New Acts of 2009\" in the January of that year. The debut album has been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Also they have received 2010 BRIT Award nominations in the categories of British Breakthrough Act and British Single for \"In for the Kill\".\n\nThey won the NME Award for Best Dancefloor Filler with \"In For The Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey remix)\". They were also the only band to be featured 4 times on the NME 50 Best Tracks of 2009 list with \"I'm Not Your Toy\" placed at #41, \"Bulletproof\" at #24, \"In For the Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey remix)\" at #19 and \"In For The Kill\" at #8.\n\nCurrently La Roux is working on a second album.\n\nOfficial site: http://www.laroux.co.uk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/La+Roux\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
