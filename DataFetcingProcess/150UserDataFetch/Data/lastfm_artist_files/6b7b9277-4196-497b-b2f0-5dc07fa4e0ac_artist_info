That same year, on December 18, they released their debut album Kinematografia. Eight days after the album was released, Magik committed suicide by jumping from the ninth floor of his apartment. After his death, the group continued giving concerts for some time, using pre-recorded material for Magik's vocals. \n\nIn September 2002, the group's sophomore album was released. Archiwum Kinematografii contains studio out-takes from the first album, and songs recorded later without Magik. In 2003 the group announced the end of Paktofonika.\n\nRahim and Fokus continue to work on other projects, like PFK Kompany and Pokahontaz.\n\nMembers:\n-Piotr „Magik” Łuszcz (1978-2000), former member of Kaliber 44;\n-Wojtek „Fokus” Alszer (1980);\n-Sebastian „Rahim” Salbert (1978);\n\nDiscography:\nJa to ja (SP) 2000\nKinematografia (album) 2000\nJestem bogiem (SP) 2001\nJestem bogiem/Chwile ulotne (vinyl) 2001\nArchiwum kinematografii (album) 2002\nArchiwum kinematografii (vinyl)\nPozegnalny koncert Paktofoniki (DVD/VHS) 2004 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paktofonika\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
