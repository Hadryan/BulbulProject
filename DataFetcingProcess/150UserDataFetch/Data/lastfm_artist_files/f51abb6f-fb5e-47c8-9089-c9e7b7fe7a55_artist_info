During performances, the trio dressed themselves in sexy lingerie. They had hits in the Netherlands and all over Europe, and were equally famous in Japan.\n\nIn 1991, the ladies of Centerfold stopped performing and Fygi (together with Rowan Moore) started a band called The Backlot. After one performance in Dutch theatre Paradiso, an album was expected, but Mercury Records had already asked Fygi to make a solo album. This first album, Introducing Laura Fygi, comprised mostly jazz numbers, and was produced by Ruud Jacobs. In the album, Fygi was accompanied by celebrated Belgian musician Toots Thielemans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Laura+Fygi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
