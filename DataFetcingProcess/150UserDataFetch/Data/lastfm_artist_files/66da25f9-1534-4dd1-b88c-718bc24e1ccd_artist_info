The group consists of Sandra Našić (vocals), Henning Rümenapp (guitar), Stefan Ude (bass) and Dennis Poschwatta (drums). Their energetic rock mix mostly described as crossover,  going from rap over funky, from melodic singing to hardcore screaming of their lead singer, made them one of the most successful German rock bands ever.\n\nThe band was already established in 1994 by Rümenapp, Ude and Poschwatta, when the vocalist Sandra Nasic joined later that year. They recorded 3 demo tapes, but their career took off in 1996 after winning the Local Hero contest for unsigned bands. They used the prize money for recording their first hit \"Open Your Eyes\" and shot a video for that song. They also signed to GUN/Supersonic Records.\n\n\"Open Your Eyes\" was released as a single (#5 GER) and was followed by their debut album Proud Like a God in 6 October 1997. The album ranked #4 and it was certified platinum in Germany. Two other singles helped the album's popularity and sales: \"Rain\" (#76 GER) and \"Lords of the Boards\" (#10 GER). \"Lord of the Boards\" is performed as the closing song on every Guano Apes concert.\n\nIn 1999, they issued the stand alone single \"Don't You Turn Your Back on Me\" (# 50 GER).\n\nIn 2 May 2000, Guano Apes released the sophomore album, Don't Give Me Names. This #1 album in Germany was certifed gold in the same country and it was promoted by four singles: \"Big in Japan\" (#9 GER, #5 IT), \"No Speech\" (#75 GER), \"Living in a Lie\" (#84 GER) and \"Dödel Up\" (#57 GER).\n\nIn 2001, the band credited as Guano Babes featuring Michael Mittermeier, issued the stand alone single \"Kumba Yo!\" (#3 GER).\n\nTheir third album Walking on a Thin Line was released in 3 February 2003. The album peaked #1 and it was certified gold in Germany. Guano Apes released three singles from this album: \"You Can't Stop Me\" (#10 GER), \"Pretty in Scarlet\" (#51 GER) and \"Quietly\" (#51 GER).\n\nAfter the very long promo tour to the WOATL album, the band decided to take a rest for a while. In 2004 they issued a Best Of album titled Planet of the Apes and the single \"Break the Line\". The band broke up after a final tour in February 2005. A year later, their label released the compilation Lost (T)apes, which contains previously unreleased demos, originally recorded in 1994 and 1995.\n\nDennis Poschwatta formed the crossover band Tamoto with his friend G-Ball and released the album Clemenza. Henning Rümenapp worked for Horus Studios in Germany. Sandra Nasic released her solo album The Signal in 2007. In 2006 Dennis, Henning and Stefan formed a new group with singer Charles Simmons, called IO. IO realeased their studio album  For the Masses in 2008.\n\nIn 2009 Guano Apes reformed and played some dates including Enterro da Gata (Portugal), Rock am Ring (Germany), Nova Rock (Austria), Woodstock Festival (Poland), Sofia (Bulgaria), Bucharest (Romania). In Bucharest, Sandra announced the band is working on a new studio album.\n\nTheir fourth album Bel Air will be released in Spring 2011, preceded by the single \"Oh What a Night\".\n\nOfficial site: http://www.guanoapes.org <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Guano+Apes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
