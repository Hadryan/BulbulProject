The result is a contemporary, often instrumental music that is much used by Games, Film and TV producers (FIFA, Adidas etc) and consequently many Skeewiff tracks will be subliminally familiar to a wide audience...\n\nThey have also collaborated with 60's legends like Hammond organist Alan Hawkshaw and remixed many similar acts like Lemon, Ursula 1000 and Amy Winehouse.\n\nThey also run their own label Jalapeno Records and more recently started Pedigree Cuts.\n\nhttp://www.skeewiff.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Skeewiff\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
