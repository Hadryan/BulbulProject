He was finally drawn to study percussion at Boston's Berklee College of Music. He took a keen interest in independent film, world cinema, and filmscore. \n\nHis primary musical venture is the solo project 'Helios', showcasing his skill in percussion, his delicate touch on the guitar, his measured and spacious songwriting, and his self-taught electro-acoustic production.\n\nMiami-based label Merck released his first album entitled 'Unomia' which went on to receive international acclaim. Less than a year after Unomia had hit the shelves, another of Keith's projects, 'Goldmund', saw the light of day with the release of 'Corduroy Road', a selection of solo piano recordings released on the young British label Type Records. This album was also well received internationally, and some of its tracks have been used in films and major television series.\n\nJune 2006 marked Keith's third full-length release on Type Records entitled 'Eingya', his most ambitious to date. Taking influence from his interest in cinema, and his extensive European travels, the resulting album is a stunning work of instrumental beauty.\n\nThe brief but breathtaking 'Ayres' EP released again on Type Records in 2007 introduces his timid, but very comfortable and intimate vocals for the first time, and marks the addition of yet another brilliant recording to his growing body of cathartic and haunting artistry.\n\nHis third album Caesura, a return back to the musical landscapes of Eingya, was released on Type in 2008.  Keith has also written music for Honda, MTV, Deutsche Telekom, Audi and others, and can be heard on a number of documentaries and films such as Harmony Korine's film \"Mr. Lonely\".\n\nKeith is currently working on a new project with his wife, Hollie, called Mint Julep and will release their new album \"Save Your Season\" in 2011. Other projects are  Mint Julep,  Goldmund, Meadows (children's music)\n\n\nKevin Kendle - ambient and new age artist\n\nHELIOS is the name under which Kevin Kendle has been writing and producing chillout music since 2002.\n\nThe first project he became involved with was the \"Buddha Experience\" series of 5 double-CD sets of Zen chillout music. Some of the tracks produced for these CDs also appeared under name PROJECT RAINBOW.\n\nMost recently, HELIOS has produced and mixed a fresh new compilation, Paradise Chillout, for the Paradise Music label. It contains 4 HELIOS tracks, including a new remix of the classic \"Tree Top,\" plus specially selected tracks from the Paradise Music range.\n\nHe usually releases his music under his own name.\n\n\n\nFrank Rössel and Martin Blechschmidt:\n\nThe German electronic pop band Helios was formed by Frank & Silke Rössel, Ricky Möller and Martin Blechschmidt  in 1997. In 2000 they signed a contract with Strahlenland Records and released their debut album, Virtually Tempted. They performed at several dancehalls and big clubs to promote their first release. In 2003, Silke and Ricky leave the band. In 2003 Helios plays their first show abroad in France for a very enthusiastic audience. In 2005 they release their second album, Copy This Day, on Absolute Music.\n\nFor samples and more info, visit www.heliosmusic.de\n\n\nRaphael Pepi\n\nAt discogs.com as Helios (5) or Raphael Pepi.
