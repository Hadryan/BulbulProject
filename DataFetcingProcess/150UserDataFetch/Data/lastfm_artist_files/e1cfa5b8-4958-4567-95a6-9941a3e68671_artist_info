This musical entity which Patterson has named after the Gaelic word for 'pure' - a word which accurately pins down the project's mindset - seems to elude strict categorization, and even the apparently all-encompassing definition of 'world music' falls short in defining the ethereal moods that \"Madre, Protégenos\", Íon's debut album, comes to reveal.\n\nThe second album, \"Immaculada\", released in 2010, continues his creative explorations.\n\nDuncan Patterson's career traces back to the early 1990s, when he began his musical incursions as a member of Anathema, a group that would pioneer and remain as forerunners of the unique death doom metal genre throughout that decade.\nPatterson would later also become involved with Antimatter, a project which would find him developing his age-old talent for emotional and atmospheric song-writing into new formats, and which he quit in late 2004 as the early sketches of what would later grow into Íon were drafted.\n\nOfficial website: http://ion.equilibriummusic.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%C3%8Don\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
