Music released under the AFX moniker tends toward a more acid-techno sound than James's other work.\n\nRichard David James was born to Welsh parents Lorna and Derek James in 1971 in Limerick, Ireland. James spent his childhood in Cornwall, UK. As a teenager, he became a DJ and musician on the local rave scene, taking on the stage name \"Aphex Twin\". James formed the Rephlex Records label in 1991 with friend Grant Wilson-Claridge and released his first records on this label in addition to Mighty Force and R&S Records of Belgium. After success with his early work, James relocated to London and released several albums and EPs on Warp Records using a number of aliases, including AFX, Polygon Window, and Aphex Twin.  Many of his lesser-known limited-edition recordings, under names such as Gak and Power-Pill, are highly prized by collectors.  Such recordings also include the AFX releases Analogue Bubblebath 2, Hangable Auto Bulb 1&2, Analord 10 (bindered edition) and releases as soit P-P and Q-chastic.\n\nIn 2005, as AFX, James produced the vinyl-only Analord series of over 11 separate 12\" singles.\n\nOn April 10th, 2006, he released the Chosen Lords album, a personal selection of songs from the highly succesful Analord series by Richard D James, with remastered, re-engineered versions of the originals on CD for the first time.\n\nQuoted in Mixmag 2006 Richard said ” I just love electronics and music and putting the two together just came naturally. I did electronics in college. Electronic music is just so lush basically I love messing with acid, jungle, and playing it out to my mates in a night club. Get out there and dance. Let’s have it! If anyone’s coming to my shows I just want everybody to just dance and have a laugh basically.”\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/AFX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
