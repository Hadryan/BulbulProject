Growing up in Peru, Elsieanne studied classical music in Lima and started composing at the age of 14. She immigrated to Montreal in 1999, where she met drummer Stephane Sotto, a self- taught musician. From the beginning, the two members have mixed more than their first names to form the group; they’ve shared influences and styles, like jazz, rock, electronic and world music. The melodies and lyrics of singer Elsieanne interlace perfectly with her singular and colourful voice, supported by the prodigious beats of Sotto. This creative fusion results in vaporous and textured compositions, swaying between a sensible pop and orchestral trip-hop.\n\nIn 2007, Elsiane launched its first album, Hybrid, which was very well received by the public and the media. The aerial and bewitching opus led the band to tour with Delerium and Beast, as well as to play the Montreal International Jazz Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, Osheaga and M for Montreal. These performances were a real consecration for Elsiane, which attracted many faithful fans with its stupefying shows, combining stunning visual and audio elements for an evocative, hypnotizing experience. After the buzz surrounding Hybrid, Elsiane has withdrawn to write new songs and to collaborate with Olivier Dufour for the Quebec City 400th anniversary main event soundtrack. The band also worked with Booka Shade, Delerium and performed for the Cirque du Soleil show, Le Royaume de Tôle.\n\nFive years after releasing Hybrid, the duo finally presents its second opus, Mechanics of Emotion. Less dark than the first record, but preserving the hooking melodies and complex arrangements, this album is a true renaissance for the duo. The band self-produced this 11 track album of organic pop, with the collaboration of sound-engineer Rob Heaney (Patrick Watson, Cirque du Soleil). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elsiane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
