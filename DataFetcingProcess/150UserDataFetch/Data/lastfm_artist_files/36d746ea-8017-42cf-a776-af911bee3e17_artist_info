Beginning their career on the West Country’s thriving live circuit, the band steadily dropped conventional gigging in favour of a mostly studio environment, where their music has been allowed to evolve in a direction unrestricted by what can be readily produced on stage. \n\nSteering away from structured songwriting, Blueneck’s music has developed into a cinematic soundscape of ambient atmospherics, dark skeletal rhythms and swirling crescendos, all created with analogue synths, sparse piano and huge, soaring guitars. Having already produced a series of demos, each one evolving further into atmospheric territory than the last, the band have teamed up with producer and musical visionary Corin Dingley for their first full-length album “Scars Of The Midwest”. \n\nBlueneck operate in a similar post-rock territory to bands such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sigur Rós, Mogwai and Kwoon, but having spent a year and a half locked away recording in the hills of deepest Somerset, they have delivered a dark, dynamic masterpiece which has a sound truly their own.\n\nhttp://blueneckuk.bandcamp.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blueneck\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
