other bands in the local music scene that shared a love of ambient, ethereal indie rock. \n\nThe Daysleepers self-released their first two EPs on their Rain Delay Music imprint. \n\nThe Daysleepers Debut EP \"Hide Your Eyes\" (December 2005) won the band many fans around the world (selling out the first pressing), and praise from shoegaze legends such as Robin Guthrie (Cocteau Twins), Rachel Goswell and Neil Halstead of Slowdive. It also hit No. 1 for several weeks on Tonevendor's (Renowned Shoegaze Distributor) top 20 record sales list. The EP is now out of print.\n\nIn October 2006 The Daysleepers released their 2nd EP/Mini Album \"The Soft Attack\". This EP shows a heavier side of the band's sound, with ethereal guitars spinning way into outerspace, and vocal melodies that hauntingly soar to new heights.\n\nAfter signing to Clairecords, the band issued their first full length album, \"Drowned in a Sea of Sound\" in May 2008. The album builds on their earlier music while retaining their trademark vocals, drums, and density of sound.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Daysleepers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
