Her videos and live performances portray the story of a once abundant Self being shattered into a variety of other personas such as Dracula, Mime, Zygote, Rozbo, etc. all being played by Jacuzzi, and all cannibalizing-commodifying their rape revenge upon the idea of an original Self which is now lost if not mythical, somewhere in the Islands of the Jacuzzi.  \n  Initially, Jacuzzi formed a number of mysterious and fleeting bands (Hot Pajamas, Sex Carpet, etc.).  Then, from 2004-2007, she fronted the band The Bubonic Plague, an influential cult favorite in LA's Echo Park district.  \n  By 2010, she debuted her first album, \"Lamaze\" on Vinyl International, a collection of songs taken from previous unofficial releases. All of the Jacuzzi/Bubonic Plague recordings were written, played and produced by Geneva herself using an 8-track cassette tape recorder. Her archive of music consists of over 400 songs, most of which have never been released.\n   \n In 2011, Jacuzzi, teaming up with long time muse and playwright, Casey Obelisk, began her latest project titled \"Dark Ages\" which pulls together most of her past and present work into an epic art video odyssey.  Functioning as a play, Part I was presented in the form of a music video montage and Vice Magazine editorial takeover which introduced the concept of the broken Creation Myth Feedback Loop (the CMFL) - the current episode being the primordial origin of Julie Zygote, a sort of edenic sacrificial alter-ego of Jacuzzi.\n  \n   Her latest installation at the LOT gallery in Louisville, titled \"Dracula's Diorama, Through the Doorwall Part VI, Act I \" portrayed a later scene in the series in which Julie Zygote and her boyfriend Dracula, while living in the depths of a fish tank, have their first meeting with the Devil cat Raminagrobis and are inducted/blackmailed into the quest for this apparently missing Self. The installation featuring an actual fishtank and video was sold through the gallery, as well as many other handmade collage pieces sold at either galleries or venues all over the world.\n \n   At the present, more episodes of the \"Dark Ages\" series along with shows and new music are currently in the works. Her hope is to run over many a body with the car service of her Self, with no accidents, and to not know where she's going. (not to mention hanging out in the laundromat  and learning how Blood Phallus Brand Fishfood, together with Swan Face Aerosol Laundry Softener, can turn any normal laundry into a sea worthy vessel)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Geneva+Jacuzzi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
