The band consists of John Arthur Webb (vocals, guitar), Kevin Hendrick (vocals, bass) and Robin Silas Christian (drums). The band has released two albums, \"Nothing Hurts\" in 2010, and \"Endless Now\", due in August 2011.\n\nRising from a flourishing DIY scene in their adopted hometown of Dalston, London, Male Bonding (typeset MALE BONDING on early releases) became a very real thing in May 2008 with their first show at an insane house party called “RAGE!”. Male Bonding was born raging and it’s been non-stop ever since. That party evolved in to a split 7\" release with PENS on Male Bonding’s own label Paradise Vendors Inc. (which sold out in a week).\n\nTo date, Male Bonding has dispatched seven releases including a Flipper tribute 7\" (on Domino Records) alongside PPM Allstars, Lovvers and Ponytail. The band has toured the UK with Brooklyn’s Vivian Girls and played shows with Lovvers, HEALTH, Fucked Up, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Graffiti Island, Mika Miko, These are Powers, NISENNENMONDAI, Magik Markers, and Finally Punk among others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Male+Bonding\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
