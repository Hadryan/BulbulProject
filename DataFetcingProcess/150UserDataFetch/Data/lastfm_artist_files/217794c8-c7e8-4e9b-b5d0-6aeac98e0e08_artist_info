She had her greatest success in Germany and Switzerland with her third album Je te dis vous, which reached 11th and 2nd place in the countries' charts respectively. A significant ingredient of her successful formula is her impressive stage presence; Kaas is almost constantly on tour internationally. In 2002 Kaas had her film debut in And now... Ladies and Gentlemen beside Jeremy Irons.\nKaas is currently on a world tour since the end of 2008 to promote her latest album kabaret. She represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia and finished 8th with the song et s'il fallait le faire.
