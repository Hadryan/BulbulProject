His first album, the relatively obscure Mark's Keyboard Repair (1995), was made up of keyboard driven pop-funk songs recorded at demo quality. It was followed up by the \"Third Version EP\" in 1996 and Push the Button in 1998.\n\nWhereas his 1996 EP was similar to his debut, \"Push the Button\" was extremely eclectic, combining aspects of Rock music and Pop with Soul, Funk and Hip-Hop. This inventive LP was met with good reviews, as was his 2001 follow up \"Change is Coming\" which had a tropical yet danceable disco and funk sound.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Money+Mark\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
