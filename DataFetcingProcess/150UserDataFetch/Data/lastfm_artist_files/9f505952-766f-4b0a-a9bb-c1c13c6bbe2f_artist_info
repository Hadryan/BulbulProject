Zach Smith from Pinback, Systems Officer, Neighborhood Watch) on bass and vocals, Pall Jenkins (The Black Heart Procession, Dark Sarcasm, Mr. Tube, Ugly Casanova) on vocals and guitar, and Tom Zinser on drums.\n\nThe group released their first album, Nà Vuccà Dò Lupù, in 1992 (before Pall could play guitar) on Cargo/Headhunter. Their next record, Chief Assassin to the Sinister, came out (also on Cargo/Headhunter) in 1994, with a vinyl version being released by Negative Records. Geffen Records took an interest in them and reissued the album but because of internal strife between the band and the label, 3MP left Geffen and returned to Headhunter. They added Tobias Nathaniel (The Black Heart Procession, The Young Destroyers, A Day Called Zero) on piano/keyboard and released Another Desert, Another Sea in 1997. A self-titled EP was released on Gravity Records the following year.\n\n3MP's early albums were heavily inspired by the cult sci-fi computer game Star Control, as evidenced by album and song titles such as Star Control Out, Chenjesu, The Ur-Quan Destroyer, and Ilwrath.\n\nAfter an unofficial break-up of sorts following their last album in 1998, Three Mile Pilot have recently reunited, signed to Touch and Go Records, and are actively writing new material for an album to be released in 2009. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Three+Mile+Pilot\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
