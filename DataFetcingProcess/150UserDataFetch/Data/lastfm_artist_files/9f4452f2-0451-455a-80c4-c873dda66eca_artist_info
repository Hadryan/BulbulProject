The album was met with lukewarm reception, but the girls were undeterred. After moving to New York, they released Light Of The Moon with Universal in 2005, with similar luck. After leaving the label and their manager to make some serious changes, they recorded their third album with producer Roger Greenawalt and after having opened a week's worth of shows for Albert Hammond Jr. [Catherine Pierce's fiancee] in November 2006, the girls were greeted with much more enthusiastic reception and excellent press.\n\nThirteen Tales of Love and Revenge was released in April 2007.\n\nThe Pierces recently gained even more press when they were featured on the December 5th episode of the hit TV show, \"Gossip Girl\".\n\nHowever, despite Catherine's high-profile celebrity romance with the Strokes guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr., the increased publicity didn't translate into sales.\n\nAccording to the You'll Be Mine Songfacts, the siblings were on the verge of calling it a day when a friend of theirs, Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman, offered to produce them. The result was The Pierces fourth album, You & I, their first release after signing to Polydor.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pierces\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
