She is probably most well known for her leading roles in the films The Day After Tomorrow, Poseidon and The Phantom of the Opera. After her role in The Phantom of the Opera, Rossum was offered several deals to record classical albums, but refused, opting to create an album of contemporary, more mainstream music. Rossum's album Inside Out was produced by Stuart Brawley. It was released on October 23, 2007 and peaked at 199 in the U.S. charts.\n\nShe cites Dolly Parton, Madonna, Cher, and Barbra Streisand as some of her influences among others. Rossum offers that, \"I was inspired to cut this album because I'm so frustrated listening to the radio these days. There is so little emotional honesty.” Her own songs are reflective of her inner thoughts, often about relationships and “getting hurt, wanting the other person back, not wanting to be the first person to go back.”\n\nShe joined Counting Crows, Augustana, and Michael Franti & Spearhead as a \"special guest\" for select performances of the \"Traveling Circus and Medicine Show\" tour in the summer of 2009. In 2010, Rossum sang a song called \"Cruel One\" on singer Alex Band's debut solo album We've All Been There. On the track she sings with Band and Chantal Kreviazuk. The song is available on the album's deluxe edition.\n\nIn November 2012, Rossum announced that her second album would be released on Warner Bros.. Sentimental Journey was released on January 29, 2013. Unlike Inside Out on which Rossum wrote the songs herself, Sentimental Journey is a collection of covers of classic songs that span the ‘20s to the ‘60s. Rossum selected these songs because \"Classics, jazz, and standards really infused my childhood and so it felt quite natural to finally make this record.” Rossum designed the album as a musical calendar that takes the listener through an emotional journey over all the months of a year - “Each song needed to either lyrically or emotionally reflect the corresponding month.” Sentimental Journey peaked at 92 on the U.S. Charts. It also hit number one on the US Billboard Charts Top Jazz Albums.\n\nRossum does not consider herself an opera singer, but she has described herself as a light lyric soprano, though she admits her voice is still developing.\n\nShe currently stars on the Showtime dramedy Shameless, as Fiona Gallagher. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Emmy+Rossum\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
