Where's Your Car Debbie?, Hey and The Hunter, were all released in 2014.\n\n2) Slaves is the project of Jonny Craig, hailing from California. Currently consisting of Colin Vieira and Weston Richmond. They released their first single \"The Fire Down Below\" on April 22, 2014 and their debut album, which is entitled \"Through Art We Are All Equals\", on June 24, 2014. The next year, Slaves released yet another album entitled \"Routine Breathing\" on August 19, 2015. Sometime after in 2016, Alex Lyman and Tai Wright both departed from the band and Slaves was left with only Jonny Craig and Colin. Also in 2016, they announced that they were working on theird third LP. On January 20, 2017 they released the first single from theird forthcoming album. The single was entitled \"I'd Rather See Your Star Explode\", a quote taken from a book that Jonny Craig had read. While there is no official release date, bassist Colin Vieira stated in a Facebook Livestream that it would most likely be released around the early Summer.\n\n\"ARE YOU SATISFIED?\", the duo's second album, was released in June 2015, preceded by the three track 7\" Feed The Mantaray in February.\n\nhttp://youareallslaves.com\n\n3) Slaves was the original name of Pleasure Forever formed by Joshua Hughes (Guitars), Andrew Rothbard (Vocals / Piano / Keyboards) and David Clifford (Drums/ Percussion). Their music is generally dark, and has a somewhat gothic/cabaret feel. Lyrical content (while heavily distorted on Alter) can be vague but is usually concerned with images of hedonism, lust, weakness of man, death and similar themes. Piano, keyboard and synthesizer are very dominant in their sound as well as very fuzzy, soft guitar sounds.  With the exception of Sonny Kay, Slaves/Pleasure Forever features all the members of The VSS. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Slaves\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
