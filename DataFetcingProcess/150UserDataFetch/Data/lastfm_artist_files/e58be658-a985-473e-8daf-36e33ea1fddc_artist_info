Their informed, crate-digger take on a genre which seems on the cusp of a major resurgence has all the lazy bombast of The Jesus & March Chain at their least “mature”: it’s a numbing wall of fuzzed-out bass, distorted guitar, combo organ and hypnotic, pounding drums drenched in echo and insouciantly bedraggled.\" - Savannah's Connect\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, hang onto your egos - here’s a band with a sonic arsenal of sounds to blow you clean away. A 5-piece set up from sunny Florida,US that make guitars and drums and blissed-out vocals sound like a blast. The underground psychedelic scene might be awash with uninspiring Brian Jonestown Massacre and BRMC impersonators, but every once in a while you stumble across a band like this who sound as if they’ve got the capabilities to push that genre furthr than it’s ever gone before. “High Low” (all the more frightening in that it’s but a demo) has got everything you could ever want to hear in a space-jam anthem - it’s fuzzy, and dirty, and just really fucking beautiful. And if this is where they’re up to at the demo stage then surely it’s but a matter of time before these guys become as interstellar as the music they’re making.\"-Daydream Generation <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Band+In+Heaven\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
