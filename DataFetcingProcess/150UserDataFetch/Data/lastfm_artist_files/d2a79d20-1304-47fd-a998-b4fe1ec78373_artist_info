The flip side of the record, \"Tous les garçons et les filles\" became a huge success, which sold 2 million copies. She had long hair and usually wore jeans with a leather jacket, while accompanying her songs on the guitar.\n\nShe sang in English, Spanish, and German occasionally. In 1963, she represented Monaco in the Grand Prix d'Eurovision de la Chanson with \"L'amour s'en va\" and emerged in fifth place. In 1968, she received the Grand Prix du Disque Académie Charles Cros.\n\nIn 1981, she married her long-time companion Jacques Dutronc, with whom she had already had a son (Thomas Dutronc) in 1973. In May 2000, she had a comeback with the album \"Clair Obscur\". Her son played the guitar, and her husband sang the duet \"Puisque vous partez en voyage\". Iggy Pop and Etienne Daho participated, as well. She currently lives near Paris.\n\nIn 2006 she released a new duets album entitled \"Parenthèses\" which included a song with her son Thomas.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fran%C3%A7oise+Hardy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
