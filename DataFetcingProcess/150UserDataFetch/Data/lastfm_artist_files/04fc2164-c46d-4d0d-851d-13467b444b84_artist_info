Windsor For the Derby opened for Swans on its final US tour, and Michael Gira was so taken with their sound and performances that he immediately offered to release them on YGR.  Their last two records \"We Fight til Death\" and \"Giving up the Ghost\" have been released on Secretly Candian along with the re-issues.\n\nThey presently live in Philadelphia and will re-release a new full-length, \"How We Lost\" this year.\n\nThey are svelte and tanned.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Windsor+For+The+Derby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
