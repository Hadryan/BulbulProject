In fact, according to the musicians, the band name is meant to describe the two styles: the self-proclaimed demon-like themes and sounds of Iced Earth and wizard-like themes and sounds of Blind Guardian (The monicker \"Demons & Wizards\" was inspired by Hansi's wife always referring to him and Jon as \"Demons and Angels.\" Hansi always corrected her that it is more properly stated \"Demons and Wizards,\" in reference to Uriah Heep's album of the same name). The band met with a fair deal of commercial success, though not as much as either of their individual bands.\n\nThe idea for the band arose in the spring of 1997 after Kürsch and Schaffer became friends while touring together in their respective bands.\n\nAlbum Information\n\nDemons & Wizards is their self-titled first album, who impressed both critics and fans of the ever popular heavy/power metal genre. Unfortunately it would be another 5 years until the follow-up album Touched by the Crimson King. The later album was recorded within the same style, inclusion and consistency. Touched by the Crimson King is based on the Dark Tower books written by Stephen King, in which The Crimson King is the main antagonist.\n\nCurrent Lineup\n\n    * Vocals: Hansi Kürsch\n    * Rythm Guitar: Jon Schaffer\n    * Drums: Bobby Jarzombek\n    * Bass: Rubin Drake\n    * Lead Guitar: Jim Morris <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Demons+&+Wizards\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
