Led by the enigmatic New York co-composers Jennifer Charles (vocals) and Oren Bloedow (guitar), the music born of their collaboration is not easy to categorize. They carry a torch for nature, sex, love, the cycle of death and rebirth, and the sounds of folk and jazz ballads, no wave and classical music, seamlessly interwoven into a style that is at once languorously romantic and tough. Their music might be described as alternative or dream pop, with the husky and sultry vocals of Charles and the filmic qualities of Bloedow's guitar work they have also been associated with the genre of rock noir or indie rock. The duo formed in 1995 and have been making discs ever since. More information (like live dates) is often found on their website - http://www.elysianmusic.com. \n\nThe two have many side projects as well. They have a Moorish inflected Sephardic band called La Mar Enfortuna, which has released records on John Zorn's label Tzadik. Jennifer is also known as the female voice and co-writer of cult band Lovage, the other members being Mike Patton and Dan The Automator. Oren used to play bass in The Lounge Lizards and his diverse guitar and bass playing skills are called on from everyone from James Chance to Martha Wainwright to Doveman.\n\nNote: This Page is for the band \"Elysian Fields\", a American based band with a sensual and romantic sound. There is another band with a similar name, The Elysian Fields, which is a Greek melodic death metal band that is currently split-up. Some of the tracks by the metal band, The Elysian Fields, have ended up listed under the band, Elysian Fields. The album 12 Ablaze is NOT by Elysian Fields, rather it is by The Elysian Fields.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elysian+Fields\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
