The album also debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 138,000 copies.\n\nIn August 2014, Grande released her second studio album My Everything, which became her second number one album in the US with 169,000 copies sold first week. Its lead single, \"Problem\" (featuring Iggy Azalea), reached number two on Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. With four Top 10 hit singles from the album, Grande spent 34 continuous weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014.
