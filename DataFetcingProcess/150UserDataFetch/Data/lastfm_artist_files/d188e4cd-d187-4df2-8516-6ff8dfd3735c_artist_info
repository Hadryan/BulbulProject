The original band consisted of:\n\n    * Feargal Sharkey (lead vocals),\n    * John O'Neill (guitar),\n    * Damian O'Neill (guitar, keyboards and vocals),\n    * Michael Bradley (bass and vocals), and\n    * Billy Doherty (drums).\n\nJohn O'Neill was the original main song writer, with his brother Damian and Mickey Bradley writing in various solo & combined variations for most of the remainder.\n\nSharkey's power pop tenor was distinctive, and the band regarded a tight ensemble. By 1977 they were performing their own three-chord pop punk material influenced by Nuggets-type material and Ramones, and in 1978 released their debut four-song EP Teenage Kicks on Good Vibrations. It became a hit with support from DJ John Peel, who considered that EP's title song (Teenage Kicks) his all-time favourite. The song has been covered by many including boyband Busted (at the 2003 Brit Awards), American group The Raconteurs, Swedish band [aritst]Sahara Hotnights and French band Nouvelle Vague.\n\nThe original band released four studio albums: \n\n    * The Undertones (1979)\n    * Hypnotised (1980)\n    * Positive Touch (1981)\n    * The Sin Of Pride (1983). \n\nFalling sales linked to their changing musical direction and tensions within the band, leading to their split in 1983. A compilation album titled All Wrapped Up featured a woman dressed in lunch meats wrapped in clear plastic on the (non band approved) cover. Several other compilations including the superb BBC sessions CD Listening In (named after a song on their first album) (2004) exist.\n\nThe O'Neill brothers went on to form That Petrol Emotion.  The Undertones reconvened in 1999, initially to play a few shows in their hometown of Londonderry, replacing singer Feargal Sharkey with a similarly warbling new recruit, Paul McLoone.  Since this time, the band has continued to play a small number of gigs each year in various places around the world.\n\nThe band have also released two further studio albums:\n\n  * Get What You Need (2003)\n  * Dig Yourself Deep (2007)\n\nNOTE:  There is another band with this name - The Undertones, a subset of the University of Notre Dame Glee Club who sing a capella arrangements of popular songs.
