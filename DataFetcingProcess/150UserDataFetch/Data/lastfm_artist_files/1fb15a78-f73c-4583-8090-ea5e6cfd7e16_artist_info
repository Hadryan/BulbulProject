He later went on to compose the famous theme music for the British television game show Countdown). It was through her father and her love for dance music that would inspire Kirsty to pursue a career in music.\n\nAt a rave event in 1991 she was noticed by producers Ian Munro, Kevin Dobbs and Nigel Walton, who at the time were known as A.S.K. It was through this meeting that they would form a Dance act called Opus III. Their first single, \"It's A Fine Day\" from their debut album Mind Fruit was an international smash and hit #1 on Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1992. They also had another US #1 hit on the Dance chart in 1994 with \"When You Made The Mountain\" from their second and last album Guru Mother.\n\nAfter the group broke up in 1994, Hawkshaw pursued a solo career and since then has been in demand by other acts in the Dance, House, Eurodance, Trance, and Electronica community, ranging from DJ Tiesto to Delerium.\n\nKirsty recorded an ambient, ethereal album, Enlightenment, which was never released.\n\nOn October 10, 2005 she released Meta-Message, a collection of older and newer songs after a growing interest in her out-of print O.U.T..\n\nOfficial Kirsty Hawkshaw Podcast - Liner Notes Oct 2007\nwww.kirstyhawkshawpodcast.com\nsubscribe in iTunes\nhttp://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=266798429\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kirsty+Hawkshaw\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
