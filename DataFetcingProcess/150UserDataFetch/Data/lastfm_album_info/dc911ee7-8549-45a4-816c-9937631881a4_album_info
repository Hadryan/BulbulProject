This last fact reflected on some of the tracks in the album, mainly on \"Animal Instinct\" and \"You and Me\".\nThe sound of the band had matured. It wasn't the melancholic and nostalgic feel of their first two albums, and it steered far apart of the anger shown in To the Faithful Departed. The themes of the songs vary, from maternity and children, to divorce and child abuse.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cranberries/Bury+the+Hatchet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
