With the exception of The Jimi Hendrix Experience cover \"Fire\", none of Mother's Milk has been played live during the band's recent career.\n\nIn 2003, a remastered version of the album was released, including several unheard bonus tracks.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Mother%27s+Milk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
