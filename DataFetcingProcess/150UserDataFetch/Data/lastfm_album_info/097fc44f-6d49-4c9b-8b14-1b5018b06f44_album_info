By many the album is deemed as a true masterpiece of melancholic, dramatical metal.\n\n\"Songs of Moors & Misty Fields\" is the last metal album by Empyrium. Their following two albums, \"Where at Night the Wood Grouse Plays\" (1999) and \"Weiland\" (2002), are purely acoustic.\n\nPersonnel:\nMarkus Stock - vocals, drums, guitars, bass\nAndreas Bach - synthesizer\nNadine Moelter - flutes, cello <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Empyrium/Songs+of+Moors+&+Misty+Fields\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
