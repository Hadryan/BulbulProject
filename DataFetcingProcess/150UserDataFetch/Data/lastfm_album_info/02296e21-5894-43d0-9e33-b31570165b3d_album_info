It's definitely got the elements of The Hunter in there, but also [of] Remission and some heavier stuff. There's a lot of different influences, from Alice in Chains to Deftones. There's a lot of rock going on.\"\n\nBrann Dailor stated following about the album: \"It's gonna be massive and insane, lots of epic greatness. There will be lots of huge riffs and new directions. It's real weird, real math-y, real straightforward. It's up, down and all around.\"\n\nBill also stated that the album's theme might be \"death\". He stated the following: \"It always makes for really good story telling. It's kind of the theme that we have a lot in our music. We've had a lot of friends pass away since the last record. I'm not really sure yet. I think we're kind of focusing more about living on this earth and what would happen if this was your last year to live. I think that's sort of maybe a little bit of what we might be kind of touching on.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mastodon/Once+More+%27Round+the+Sun\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
