The album's non-chronological sequence highlights 2Pac's career; the 21 popular hits, some slightly re-edited for legal reasons, are accompanied by four previously unreleased songs: the dead friends tribute \"God Bless the Dead\", the dedication song \"Unconditional Love\", the tough talk \"Troublesome '96\", and the album's single \"Changes\" also helped earn 2Pac the first and only posthumous Grammy Award nomination since for Best Rap Solo Performance. Some tracks have alternate mixes, while \"California Love\" makes its first proper album appearance after only being available as a single prior.\n\nThis is one of 2Pac's two albums—and one of only seven hip hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States.\n\nGreatest Hits debuted at No. 5 with 268,000 and peaked at No. 3 in January 1999. It has spent 77 weeks on the Billboard 200.  It topped the R&B charts in the United States for 2 weeks in a row. On October 16, 2000 it was certified 9× platinum. Nearly 11 years later, in June 2011, it was certified by the RIAA for shipments of over 10 million copies, the late rapper's first ever RIAA Diamond award. The album is one of the best selling albums of all time in America.\n\nTupac Shakur's virtual appearance at the annual Coachella Festival on April 15 spurred a re-entry for the album on the Billboard 200 chart; it jumped in at No. 129 with 4,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan (a gain of 571% over the previous week).\n\nThe album was certified Platinum by BPI by 16 August 2002 which makes it his highest selling album in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
