The second single, \"Deny,\" was featured on the soundtrack of the popular NHL 2003 game by EA Sports and also received a great deal of air time, helping launch Default into the mainstream of Canadian rock.\n\nA special edition of this CD, alongside a DVD, included the bonus track \"Blind\" and acoustic versions of the lead singles \"Deny\" and \"Wasting My Time.\" An acoustic version of the final track, \"Let You Down,\" also served as the final track to Default's sophomore effect, Elocation. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Default/The+Fallout\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
