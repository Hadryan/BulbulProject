It was her first solo project after leaving The Sugarcubes, but was not her actual debut, as she released the self-titled album Björk in 1977. The record was produced by Nellee Hooper and established Björk's audience outside of Iceland and cult followings in the UK, U.S. and elsewhere. Sonically, the album is a mix of dance beat-driven pop (\"Violently Happy\", \"Big Time Sensuality\", \"There's More to Life Than This\"), earthy, new age (\"One Day\", \"The Anchor Song\", \"Aeroplane\", \"Human Behaviour\"), and seductive, rhythm-based songs (\"Venus as a Boy\", \"Come to Me\"). Debut has been certified Platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA and is also featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nIn 1998, Q magazine readers voted Debut the 74th greatest album of all time. The album has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. It has also sold 921,000 copies in U.S. according to SoundScan.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/Debut\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
