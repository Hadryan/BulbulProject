There is an organic feel to the disc that separates it from their more angst-ridden peers, specifically those who rely on electronic gadgetry over a simple guitar-bass-drums setup, though the congenial feel fits in alongside Incubus, especially with a propensity toward pensive moments that evoke a softer image than most, one that would fit into emo if the band wasn't so obviously aesthetically a rock band; \"These Walls\" actually sounds like Nickelback at its most adult rock-radio-friendly, for example. Trapt isn't original, per se, as much as it does a good job melding its pronounced influences more seamlessly than most; the band would get a better recommendation if the record had songs that stood out a bit more. ~ Brian O'Neill, Rovi <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Trapt/Trapt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
