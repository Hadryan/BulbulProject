Records.The album cover is a photo of Lake Placid.America was recorded using both electronic sounds and live recordingsAn anechoic chamber was built in Baltimore to record the orchestral track \"Rail.\"The reason Deacon decided to incorporate live instruments onto the album was that Deacon felt that electronic beats were limited by its lack of flaws and that he wanted the \"slight imperfection in timing\" human musicians have.[3] Because he wanted the album to sound \"more like a rock record\" than an electronic one, Deacon enlisted King Crimson engineer Simon Heyworth to master the album.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Deacon said that the album was inspired by the politics and geography of the United States, saying: “The music is definitely inspired by geography. I do many, many cross-country trips a year because I tour, and it's hard to — you could really despise every aspect of what you think American culture is but it's hard to deny that the land itself is beautiful. Do you know what I mean?\"\n\nDeacon described the album as \"political,\" saying that the lyrics were \"[..] inspired by my frustration, fear and anger towards the country and world I live in and am a part of.\"[5] However, Deacon also said that he did not want the political nature to be overt, arguing that people do not respond to overt political messages <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Deacon/America\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
