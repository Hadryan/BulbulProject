It was released in the United States on 20 June 1966 by London Records as their sixth American album. The album proved to be a major artistic breakthrough for the band, being the first full-length release by the band to consist exclusively of Mick Jagger/Keith Richards compositions. Aftermath was also the first Rolling Stones album to be recorded entirely in the US, at the legendary RCA Studios in Hollywood, California at 6363 Sunset Boulevard, and the first album the band released in true stereo.\n\nThe album is also notable for its musical experimentation, with Brian Jones playing a variety of instruments not usually associated with rock musicâ€”including sitar on \"Paint It, Black\" and \"Mother's Little Helper\", the Appalachian dulcimer on \"Lady Jane\" and \"I Am Waiting\", the marimbas (African xylophone) on \"Under My Thumb\" and \"Out of Time\", harmonica on \"High and Dry\" and \"Goin' Home\", as well as guitar and keyboards. Much of the music was still rooted in Chicago electric blues.\n\nIn August 2002 both editions of Aftermath were reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Aftermath\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
