Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado, released by Geffen Records June 20, 2006 in North America (see 2006 in music). Timbaland and his then-protégé Danja produced the bulk of the album, which incorporates influences of dance, R&B and hip hop. The album explores the theme of female sexuality and has been described as introspective or even sad in parts.

Timbaland and his then-protégé Danja produced the bulk of the album, which incorporates influences of dance, R&B and hip hop. The album explores the theme of female sexuality and has been described as introspective or even sad in parts. Its influence comes from some of the themes expressed in the material of artists such as Janet Jackson.\n\nThe album received criticism because of the sexual image Furtado adopted for the recording, with some feeling it was a ploy to sell more records. Further controversy rose over accusations of plagiarism on Timbalands part when recordings were leaked onto Youtube. The record was seen generally as critically and commercially successful. It reached high positions on charts across the world, and according to a November 2007 press release, it had sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe album was heavily promoted, released in several editions and was supported by the Get Loose Tour, which is the subject of the concert DVD Loose: The Concert. Eight singles were released from the album, including the U.S. number-one singles \"Promiscuous\" and \"Say It Right\", which received Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively. Other stand out singles include the UK number-one single \"Maneater\" and the successful song \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nelly+Furtado/Loose\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
