After she and Mark Brydon dissolved their electronic duo Moloko, Murphy began working with producer and musician Matthew Herbert, known for his musique concrète approach to music. The songs were first released through three extended plays and were then compiled into a studio album.\n\nThe album often samples sounds made by everyday objects and actions, including cosmetics, brass mice, dancing and ornaments.[1] It mixes the electronic music for which Moloko was known with jazz and pop styles. The album received positive reviews from music critics.\n\nRuby Blue was commercially unsuccessful upon its June 2005 European release, charting at #88 in the United Kingdom, and fared poorly when released in the United States the next year. It produced two singles, \"If We're in Love\" and \"Sow into You\". Songs from the album were used in the television series Grey's Anatomy and So You Think You Can Dance.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R%C3%B3is%C3%ADn+Murphy/Ruby+Blue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
