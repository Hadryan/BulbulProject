The album was produced by Björn Yttling of Peter Bjorn and John, who also handled production for Li's debut album, Youth Novels (2008). Li spent six months writing and recording the album in the Echo Park neighbourhood of Los Angeles while visiting the desert, examining Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1973 film The Holy Mountain, and listening to field recordings by Alan Lomax. She eventually came up with the songs as she calls \"hypnotic, psychotic and more primal\". \n\nLi unveiled the album's artwork and track listing on her official website on 14 December 2010. Throughout its release, the album produced four singles. \"Get Some\" was released as the album's lead single in Sweden on 22 October 2010.
