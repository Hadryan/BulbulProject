It was released by Warp Records in October 2005. The album took the duo three years to make.\n\nThis album featured the addition of heavily treated acoustic guitars and the use of more conventional song structures.\n\n“We usually imagine our music to have a visual element while we're writing it, so we were picturing this character losing his mind at the campfire and compressing weeks of events into a few hours, in that time-stretching way that acid fucks with your perception.\", Michael Sandison.\n\nThe track \"Oscar See Through Red Eye\" was released digitally on 5 September 2005 by Bleep.com, an online shop maintained by Warp Records. On 4 October 2005, the track \"Dayvan Cowboy\" was released through iTunes.\n\nIn April 2006, a music video for the song \"Dayvan Cowboy\" was released on the Warp Records website. The video consists of footage from Joe Kittinger's famous parachute jump from 19.5 miles (31.4 km) altitude, and later slow-motion footage of big-wave surfer Laird Hamilton. The video was directed by Melissa Olson.\n\nMusic from The Campfire Headphase has been used heavily in commercial bumpers for the U.S. late-night television network Adult Swim.\n\nA poster of this album can be seen in the British comedy The IT Crowd hanging in the main characters' office.\n\nThe track \"Dayvan Cowboy\" was featured in a GMC advertisement (on the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in Charleston, SC) for the new GMC Yukon Hybrid, as well as the television programme Search For Second Earth on the Science Channel.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/The+Campfire+Headphase\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
