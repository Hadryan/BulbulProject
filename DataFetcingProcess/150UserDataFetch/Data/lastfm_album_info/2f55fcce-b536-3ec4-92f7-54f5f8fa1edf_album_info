It was released on 27 September 2004 in Germany and followed shortly by its release across Europe. It was released in North America on 16 November 2004. It was in the top ten in several European charts and a number one hit in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Iceland, Finland, Estonia  and Mexico. As of February 2006, the album has shipped 1.5 million copies globally.\n\nAs used in \"Reise, Reise aufstehen! Kommt hoch nach alter Seemannsart\", the album name is an old Low German sailor's expression to waken other sailors, hence the translation of the title would be \"Arise, Arise\", as seen in the song of the same name. Given Rammstein's propensity to use puns, a double meaning could well be intended, as the standard High German translation of \"Reise\" is \"journey\" or \"travel\".\n\nThe album art shows a damaged airplane cockpit voice recorder depicted on the front and back covers. Its caption (\"Flugrekorder, nicht öffnen\") means \"Flight Recorder, Do Not Open\". The inner part of the Digipak edition case shows a picture of the six members in suits wielding suitcases and weapons leaving from a crashed airplane.\n\nThe cover art is an allusion to the song \"Dalai Lama\", which deals with an airplane accident. It is also suggestive of the overarching 'travelling' theme of the album.\n\nThe airplane accident of which the album is based occurred on the 12th of August, 1985. A Boeing 747, Japan Airlines Flight 123 took off from Tokyo International Airport and about 30 minutes later, crashed into the side of a mountain. 520 out of the 524 passengers and crew died, and as of 2008 it is still the deadliest single aircraft disaster in history. Curiously, the band also added the final moments of Flight 123 as a hidden pregap track on the UK and European copies of the disk as an Easter egg.\n\nThe song \"Reise, Reise\" itself contains a recording of the last 40 seconds of the flight in which the onboard computer is warning \"Pull up! Pull up!\" and the pilots shout in panicked Japanese, however, on the European pressings, the track has to be rewound before the 0:00 mark to be heard. On the US release, the recording is the beginning of \"Reise, Reise\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rammstein/Reise,+Reise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
