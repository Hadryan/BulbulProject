The album contains the single \"Spoon\", which charted in the Top 10 in Germany, largely because of its use as the theme of a German TV thriller series called \"Das Messer\" (The Knife). The success of the single allowed Can to move to a better studio in which they recorded Ege Bamyası. Ege Bamyası was remastered as a hybrid SACD in 2004 which includes a booklet with commentary on the album by former Melody Maker journalist David Stubbs, as well as previously unreleased photos of the band.\n\nThe cover artwork, in addition to being a pun on the band's name (as it depicts a can labeled \"CAN\"), reflects several of the band members' continued interest in traditional music; \"Ege Bamyası\" means \"Aegean Okra\" in Turkish. The album has received much critical acclaim since its release and has been cited as an influence by various artists. There have been attempts by several artists to play cover versions of songs from Ege Bamyası. Remix versions of several tracks by various artists are included on the album Sacrilege. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Can/Ege+Bamyasi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
