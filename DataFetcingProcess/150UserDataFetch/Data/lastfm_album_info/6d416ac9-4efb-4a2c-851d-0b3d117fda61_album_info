Produced by Rick Rubin, it was the band's first record released on Warner Bros. Records. \nThe musical styles of Blood Sugar Sex Magik differed notably from the techniques employed on the band's preceding album, Mother's Milk (1989), and featured little use of heavy metal guitar riffs. The album's subject matter incorporated sexual innuendos and references to drugs and death as well as themes of lust and exuberance.\n\nThe album has sold over seven million copies in the United States alone and became the Red Hot Chili Peppers' introduction into popularity and critical acclaim. Blood Sugar Sex Magik produced many hits for the band, including \"Give It Away\", \"Under the Bridge\", \"Suck My Kiss\", and \"Breaking the Girl\". \n\nThe record also marked the departure of guitarist John Frusciante mid-tour in 1992, until his return in 1998.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Blood+Sugar+Sex+Magik\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
