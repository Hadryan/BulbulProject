The record, mostly a collection of downbeat tracks, features ambient echoing vocals and minimally-treated instruments, with the album's sonic direction driven by its drum sound. Due to budgetary restraints, the record was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between £2000 and £3000, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/Seventeen+Seconds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
