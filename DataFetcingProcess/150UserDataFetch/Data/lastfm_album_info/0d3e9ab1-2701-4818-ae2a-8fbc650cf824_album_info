It has spent over 150 weeks on the catalog albums chart and over 110 weeks on the billboard top 200 chart.\n\nFor the band's debut release manager Jeff Hanson matched them up with John Kurzweg, a producer friend who, with his unobtrusive production style and talents as a songsmith and multi-instrumentalist, he felt was a great fit. Together the album was recorded for $6,000, which was funded by Hanson. My Own Prison was released independently in 1997 on their own Blue Collar Records. The album was distributed to Florida radio stations, and their enthusiasm for the record helped it sell 6,000 copies in the first two months in Florida alone. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Creed/My+Own+Prison\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
