Frusciante has stated that this was his most expensive album to date, costing around $300,000 to produce. \n\nAll tracks were written by Frusciante himself and the majority of the vocal work is also performed by him. Another notable feature of this album is Frusciante's newfound ability to sing in a more professional-sounding and stronger voice than ever before.\n\nFellow Chili Pepper, bassist Flea plays a double bass on \"The Slaughter\", the closing track of the album. Other notable contributers came from Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, The Mars Volta frontman Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, Josh Klinghoffer and Charlie Clouser. \n\nFrusciante also made acoustic and demo versions of these tracks available to fans through his official site, as an alternative to the highly produced sound of the record.\n\nThe album reached #191 on the Billboard 200 and #11 on Heatseekers. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Frusciante/Shadows+Collide+With+People\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
