The album was recorded at Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, Sweden between November 1, 2007 and December 13, 2007. Watershed is the first studio album by Opeth to feature drummer Martin Axenrot and guitarist Fredrik Åkesson. The artwork for the album was made by Travis Smith (who has done the artwork for eight previous Opeth releases) in collaboration with Mikael Åkerfeldt and has been publicly available as of March 30.\n\nIt was released in standard, 180 gram vinyl, and special edition versions. The special edition version includes three bonus tracks, a bonus DVD with a 5.1 surround sound mix of the entire album (not including bonus tracks), video content featuring rehearsals, and studio footage as well as expanded artwork. The vinyl release came in cardboard gatefold packaging and contained the album on two vinyl discs as well as a CD copy of the album (both included the bonus track \"Derelict Herds\") and a poster. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Opeth/Watershed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
