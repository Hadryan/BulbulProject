From its emotion-rousing, self-titled opener, to the darkly cinematic ‘Fear Is Like Fire,’ and the uplifting nostalgia of album closer ‘Berlin Sunrise’, the ‘Perfect Darkness LP’ bristles with tense passion and hypnotic charm. It is in two words, bewitching and addictive.\n\nFollowing three critically-acclaimed albums, ‘Perfect Darkness’ marks the next chapter of an incredible musical journey for the Bristol-born artist. The first and pre-eminent singer-songwriter signed to legendary British label Ninja Tune – after making the transition from world-class club DJ and electronic producer – Fink is also an in-demand collaborator having written for the likes of John Legend, Ximena Sarinana, Amy Winehouse and Professor Green. He has also graced some of the world’s most prestigious stages, and with bandmates Guy Whittaker on bass and Tim Thornton on drums, has toured the globe several times over.\n\nUp until now Fink has remained in the shadows, working quietly and diligently in the background, but judging by this new record he is set to emerge into the bright lights of long-deserved mass recognition.\n\nTracklisting:\nPerfect Darkness \t\nFear Is Like Fire \t\nYesterday Was Hard On All Of Us \t\nHonesty \t\nWheels \t\nWarm Shadow \t\nSave It For Somebody Else \t\nWho Says \t\nFoot It In The Door \t\nBerlin Sunrise <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fink/Perfect+Darkness\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
