Among the songs recorded for the album, but omitted from the final product, were Self Ignition  (released as a B-side on the Send in the Clouds  single) and Police Conversation, 1783, which was never released. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Silver+Jews/American+Water\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
