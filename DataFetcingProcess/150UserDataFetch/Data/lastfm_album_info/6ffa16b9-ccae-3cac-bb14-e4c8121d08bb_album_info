Breakfast,\" and 2007's \"Distance and Time,\" Fink returns in 2009 with the self-produced \"Sort of Revolution.\"Title track, \"Sort of Revolution\" opens the record over a falling chord sequence. \"Move On Me,\" co-written with John Legend and featuring the soul star on piano, taps into the broody and bluesier side of Fink's character, while \"Q&A\" is an a-cappella based number inspired by classic D'Angelo, embellished with vocal harmonies. \"If I Had A Million\" is a solo vox and guitar cut - a song about what it would mean to Fink and his love if he ever earned a million bucks, while \"Pigtails\" features the unique talents of Canadian multi-instrumentalist and ex-Crash Test Dummies member Son of Dave. John Legend returns for another co-write on the menacing \"Maker,\" before Fink rounds things off with an exemplary cover of Jeff Barry's 70's classic \"Walking In The Sun.\" \n\nThere are very few independent artists who have quietly accomplished such an amazing array of achievements. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fink/Sort+of+Revolution\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
