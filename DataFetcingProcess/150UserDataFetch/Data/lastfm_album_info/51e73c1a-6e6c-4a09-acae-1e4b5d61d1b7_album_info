Released on 10 February 1997 in the UK, it reached the top of the UK album chart. Blur was also a hit in the US, with song 2 becoming a hit there and the album being certified Gold. It also spawned several hit singles in the UK, most notably beetlebum and \"Song 2\". The album's style was resultant of Blur's dropping their previous britpop mantle in favor of lo-fi and alternative rock recordings, reportedly at graham coxon 's urging. As a result, Blur was a hit primarily because it proved that Blur could evolve beyond their Britpop roots. The album's move from Britpop was emphasised by this being the first Blur album not to use Stylorouge cover-art and also not to have lyrics and chords printed in the liner notes, instead having a composite photo of the band in the studio spread out over three panels. The album featured the first song in which Graham Coxon not only wrote the lyrics, but also provided lead vocals, for the song You're So Great. He would later do the same for coffee & TV for Blur's next album.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/Blur\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
