It marked the return of longtime lead singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith to the band. It was also the band's first studio recording with three guitar players, as Janick Gers stayed with the band after Smith's return.\n\nThe album art and title song are references to the novel of the same name written by Aldous Huxley. The upper half of the album art was done by Derek Riggs, and is the last new artwork done by Riggs to be used on an Iron Maiden release.\n\nThe songs \"The Wicker Man\" and \"Out of the Silent Planet\" were both released as singles. \"The Wicker Man\" was released in the U.S as a promo single with extra vocals in the chorus.\n\n\"The Nomad\", \"Dream of Mirrors\", and \"The Mercenary\" were originally written for Virtual XI, according to Adrian Smith in an interview. He said there was a fourth song, but he didn't know which one it was and that Steve Harris did not remember either. Former singer Blaze Bayley also co-wrote \"Dream Of Mirrors\", but wasn't credited. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Brave+New+World\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
