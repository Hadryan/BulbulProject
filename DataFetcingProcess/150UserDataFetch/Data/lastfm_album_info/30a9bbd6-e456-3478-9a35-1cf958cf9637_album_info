It was first released on October 22, 1990. It was also released in Japan with an additional CD3.\n\nAlthough a popular album among fans, in the context of Pet Shop Boys' other albums, Behaviour differs in production value. Harold Faltermeyer was hired on to produce the album at his \"Red Deer\" studio in Munich, Germany. Because they were dissatisfied with the available digital synthesisers and samples, Pet Shop Boys wanted to use analogue synthesisers. Faltermeyer was a good choice for producer, as he happened to be an expert on analog equipment. The result was a Pet Shop Boys album different from both the previous album, Introspective and the 1993 follow-up, Very. In places, the album expands upon the synthpop genre with flavours of guitar pop ballads, as with \"This must be the place I waited years to leave\" and \"My October symphony\" featuring guitarist, Johnny Marr. Later, singer Neil Tennant would reflect on the different style of Behaviour, \"It was more reflective and more musical-sounding, and also it probably didn't have irritatingly crass ideas in it, like our songs often do\". Tennant later reflected the album was inspired by fellow synthpop group Depeche Mode's album Violator, which was also released in 1990.\n\nAs with most of the group's albums up to 2001, Behaviour was re-released as Behaviour/Further Listening 1990-1991. The re-released version was digitally remastered and came bundled with a second disc of B-sides and previously unreleased material recorded around the time of the album's original release. Notable songs on the second disc include \"Miserablism,\" \"DJ Culture,\" \"Was It Worth It,\" and the Ambient Mix of \"Music for Boys.\" \"Miserablism\", a poignant satire of Morrissey, was intended for inclusion on Behaviour up until the day it was sent for mastering. It later became the b-side for \"Was it worth it?\" and was remixed by Moby for the 12\"; the latter was re-released on the limited edition version of the 2003 compilation album, Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits). \"DJ Culture\" and \"Was it worth it?\" were the two singles recorded for the Pet Shop Boys' 1991 compilation album, Discography: The Complete Singles Collection. \"Music for Boys,\" was originally credited as \"Music for Boys Part 2\" and was the b-side to \"DJ Culture.\" The original b-side version can also be found on the 1995 compilation album Alternative) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pet+Shop+Boys/Behaviour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
