It was released in 1992 and produced by Kalle Trapp. The cover artwork was created by Andreas Marschall, who has also drawn the artwork for some more of Blind Guardian's releases (Tales from the Twilight World, Nightfall in Middle-Earth, etc.). The album saw the band creating its own original sound, while still employing most of their speed/power metal techniques. The strong songwriting of the album (including fan favorite The Bard's Song) made the album a power metal staple. The image of the cover and the two Bard's Songs gave the band its nickname \"The Bards\". The use of the nickname has been also extended to the fans of the group, Circle of the Bards being the now defunct fan club and Hansi frequently calling the fans Bards.\n\nThe album was acclaimed by power metal fans all across Europe and especially Japan, allowing them to tour for the first time outside Germany. The tour in the Far East led to the first live album of the band, Tokyo Tales.\n\nRemastered and re-released on 15 June 2007, with bonus tracks.\n\nTrack listing:\n1. \"Time What Is Time\" – 5:42\n2. \"Journey Through the Dark\" – 4:45\n3. \"Black Chamber\" – 0:56\n4. \"Theatre of Pain\" – 4:15\n5. \"The Quest for Tanelorn\" – 5:53\n6. \"Ashes to Ashes\" – 5:58\n7. \"The Bard's Song (In the Forest)\" – 3:09\n8. \"The Bard's Song (The Hobbit)\" – 3:52\n9. \"The Piper's Calling\" – 0:58\n10. \"Somewhere Far Beyond\" – 7:28\n\nBonus Tracks:\n11. \"Spread Your Wings\" (Queen cover) – 4:13\n12. \"Trial by Fire\" (Satan cover) – 3:42\n13. \"Theatre of Pain\" (Classic version)  – 4:13\n\n2007 Re-release Bonus Tracks:\n14. \"Ashes to Ashes\" (Demo Version) – 5.51\n15. \"Time What is Time\" (Demo Version)\n\nNote: the 2007 re-release has all the previous bonus tracks, although they are not listed as such. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blind+Guardian/Somewhere+Far+Beyond\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
