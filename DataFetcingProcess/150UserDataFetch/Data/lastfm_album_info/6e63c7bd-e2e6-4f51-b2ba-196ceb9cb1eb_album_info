A prime example is “Goose Blues”, on which a deep, simple guitar line intertwines with an affecting vocal and a chorus to rival the blues classics of old, over a raw, stripped-back beat. The next track “Like 4 The Hard Way” is a song that Belleruche originally wrote for ‘Turntable Soul Music’ - and the cheeky textures and electronic flourishes added into the mix by DJ Modest nod to their previous work - but it has been toughened up in the studio and finds its rightful place on this album. “Rumble Strip” does what it says on the tin, with an insistent driving rhythm section shot through with funk-inspired guitar licks and a fiery vocal. “Late Train” blasts into life with a powerful, catchy horn hook and swings between a dark, brooding verse and a soaring chorus which always goes down a storm in live sets. The earthy crackle of “The Duck” sounds like a well worn favourite funk/soul record and pays homage to Belleruche’s love of dusty vinyl and twisted, off kilter sounds. “You’re Listening To The Worlds” is a blissful way to round off the record, with a calm, peaceful feel punctuated by ripples of atmospheric guitar and turntable magic. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Belleruche/The+Express\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
