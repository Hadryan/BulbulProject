From Her To Eternity\nReleased on May 11, 1998.\nNick Cave asked each of the Bad Seeds members, past and present, to choose their favorite tracks from the ten albums at that pointâ€”their lists would then be discussed until a final list was produced. Only guitarist and founding Bad Seed Mick Harvey responded, and it is his listing, unchanged, that makes up The Best Of.\nTracks 1 and 11 are taken from the 1988 album Tender Prey.\nTracks 2, 5 and 10 are taken from the 1994 album Let Love In.\nTrack 3 is taken from the 1992 album Henry's Dream.\nTrack 4 is taken from the 1985 album The Firstborn Is Dead.\nTracks 6 and 9 are taken from the 1986 album Your Funeral... My Trial.\nTracks 7 and 8 are taken from the 1997 album The Boatman's Call.\nTracks 12 and 15 are taken from the 1996 album Murder Ballads.\nTracks 13 and 14 are taken from the 1990 album The Good Son.\nTrack 16 is taken from the 1984 album From Her to Eternity.\nNOTE: Tracks 2, 4, 10, 11 and 14 are the edited single versions (but are not listed as edits in the liner notes).\nSpecial Edition Bonus CD: Live At The Royal Albert Hall\n1. Lime Tree Arbour \n2. Stranger Than Kindness\n3. Red Right Hand \n4. Let Love In\n5.  Brompton Oratory\n6. Henry Lee\n7. The Weeping Song\n8. The Ship Song\n9. Where The Wild Roses Grow\nThe album was also released as a special edition with a live bonus disc, titled \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\", recorded on 19 and 20 May 1997. This bonus CD was subsequently released in 2008 as a regular disk, with four additional tracks but without \"The Weeping Song\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Cave+&+The+Bad+Seeds/The+Best+of\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
