Metallica's ninth studio album, it was the first to be produced by Rick Rubin. It was recorded April 2007–May 2008.\n\nIt is the band's first studio album to feature current bassist Robert Trujillo. Death Magnetic is also the band's first studio album released through Warner Bros. Records, although they still remain with Warner Music Group, which also owns their previous label, Elektra Records. Outside of North America, they are distributed by Universal Music Group as they remain signed to Vertigo Records in the United Kingdom. \n\nThe album was well received by fans and critics alike, and has been considered a return to form for the band in the mold of the band's classic albums Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice for All. However, it has been criticised for its sound quality, as all commercially available releases were mixed at an unusually loud volume that resulted in digital clipping, causing the album to have low dynamic range and a muffled sound. The album's mastering engineer Ted Jensen stated that he was dissatisfied with the final product. The version of the album released through Guitar Hero III did not feature these problems, and several fan-made mixes of this version became popular as a result. A remaster of the album featuring significantly expanded dynamic range was eventually released through iTunes in 2015 and through Metallica's official website in 2016.\n\nFour outtakes from this album's sessions were released in 2012 as Beyond Magnetic.\n\nGrammy Nominations (4)\n\nBest Rock Album \nBest Metal Performance (\"My Apocalypse\") \nBest Rock Instrumental Performance (\"Suicide & Redemption\") \nBest Recording Package \n\nPlatinum Album in the U.S., Gold in the U.K.\nFifth consecutive Metallica album to debut at number 1 on the Billboard 200 in the US.\n\nInformation from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica's_ninth_studio_album <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Death+Magnetic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
