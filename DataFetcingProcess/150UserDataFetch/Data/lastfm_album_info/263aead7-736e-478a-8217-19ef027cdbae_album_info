It contains Dutch chart topping hit singles Back it up and A Night like This.Deleted Scenes from the Cutting Room Floor is the debut album by Dutch singer Caro Emerald. It was released January 29, 2010, in the Netherlands.[2]\nIn its first week it immediately debuted at number one in the Dutch Album Top 100 and has remained on top ever since, except for two weeks in April and June. On 19 November 2010 the album set an all time chart record by spending itÂ´s 29th week at number one,[3] beating previous record holder Michael Jackson's Thriller by three weeks (although that album still holds the record for most consecutive weeks at number one, with 30 weeks).[4]\nFollowing an error by Dutch chart company GfK it was announced in March 2010 that after eight weeks at number one, Caro held the record for most weeks at one by a Dutch debut artist. However, Dutch band Krezip had spent ten weeks at number one with their debut album in 2000.\nIn total the album sold more than 350,000 copies until now. [5]\nIn August 2010, Caro announced her album would be released in the UK by Dramatico Records. It is also available in Italy where it peaked at number 50[6] and in France at 92.[7]\nBackground:\nAccording to Emerald's Twitter account, the album's name refers to a figurative term in the film industry. Scenes were cut in the so called cutting room, where the deleted and therefore unused scenes fell to the cutting room floor.[8]\n[e <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Caro+Emerald/Deleted+Scenes+From+The+Cutting+Room+Floor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
