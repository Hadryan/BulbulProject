Released in 1993, it explores themes of love and morality in a noticeably upbeat mood compared to his previous release, the introspective The Soul Cages.\n\nThis album contained two U.S. hits; \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\" reached #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \"Fields of Gold\" reached #23.\n\nTen Summoner's Tales was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1993. In 1994, it was nominated for five Grammy awards, winning Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\") and Best Long Form Music Video. It lost Album of the Year and Record of The Year for the above mentioned song.\n\nA long form video featuring alternate musical performances and live versions of all tracks was filmed at Lake House and released in conjunction with the album. The video went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video in 1994 and was directed by Doug Nichol and produced by Julie Fong.\n\nThe 1998 re-release CD includes a bonus video track of \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\". It also features the song \"Everybody Laughed But You\", which was excluded from the original 1993 release in the US and Canada. The song did appear on the original release in the UK, Europe, Japan and other territories, and the \"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\" single. The instrumental track for \"Everybody Laughed But You\" was also used with an alternate lyric and released as \"January Stars\" on the \"Seven Days\" and \"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\" singles.\n\nThe cover of the album was photographed at Wardour Old Castle in Wiltshire, England, featuring Hrímnir, an Icelandic horse Sting owned for a period. The album was recorded at Lake House, Wiltshire, mixed at The Townhouse Studio, London and mastered at Masterdisk, New York.\n\nA different version of \"It's Probably Me,\" featuring Eric Clapton, was featured in the opening titles of Lethal Weapon 3. This version is available as a single. In 1994, \"Shape of My Heart\" was featured in the end credits of Léon, replacing Eric Serra's The Experience of Love (a track that Serra eventually used in his 1995 soundtrack for the James Bond film GoldenEye). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sting/Ten+Summoner%27s+Tales\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
