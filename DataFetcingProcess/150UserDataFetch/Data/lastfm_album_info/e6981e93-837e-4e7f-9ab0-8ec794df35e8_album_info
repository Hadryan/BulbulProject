Rex (being the second album under the name \"T. Rex\", with the first four billed as \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\"). \n\nThe album marks a big turning point in the band's sound as it dispenses with the folk-oriented music of the previous albums and takes on a new music genre, glam rock. The album also drew attention to the band in the USA with the massive hit \"Get It On\". Though the album is full of rock classics, several of the songs still display something of the lyrical poetics of the previous albums, with \"Cosmic Dancer\", \"Monolith\" and \"Girl\" all flirting with such 'deep' ideas as re-incarnation, fate and the divine.\n\nThe cover artwork was designed by British art design group Hipgnosis, based on a photo taken by Kieron \"Spud\" Murphy at a T. Rex concert at the Albert Hall, Nottingham on 14th May 1971.\n\nPersonnel\nMarc Bolan – vocals, guitars\nMickey Finn – conga drums, bongos\nSteve Currie – bass guitar\nBill Legend – drums\nHoward Kaylan – backing vocals\nMark Volman – backing vocals\nRick Wakeman – keyboards on \"Get It On\"\nIan McDonald – saxophone\nBurt Collins – flugelhorn \n\nProduction\nTony Visconti – production\nRoy Thomas Baker – music engineer\nGeorge Underwood – artwork, photography\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/T.+Rex/Electric+Warrior\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
