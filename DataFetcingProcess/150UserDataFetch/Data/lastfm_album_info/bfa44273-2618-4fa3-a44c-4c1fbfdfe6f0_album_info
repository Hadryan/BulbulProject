Superb, accomplished 17 track album for Dealmaker... Post-Dilla beats stumble amongst the emotive selection of samples - all lovingly selected and processed to provide a perfect seasonal soundtrack - Bleep (Album of the Week)\n\n“Lens Flare Lagoon conjures up the glistening, watery effect suggested by its name, and 'Buried Coral Banks' has a Boards Of Canada-meets-Jacques Cousteau feel that's hard not to love” – Boomkat (Album of the Week)\n\nReleased last September in the UK, the response to the album generated was incredible with praise coming from artists like Daedelus, Rustie, James Holden and end of year love coming from XLR8R, Bleep, Boomkat and Kode9 all rating the album in the best of year round ups. \n\nSummertime is here… so what better way to escape the British drizzle than with “lemurian”, the excellent new album from Lone.  Dusty snares rub alongside VHS fuzz, delicate melodies blend into dreamlike drops and low-end rumbles are taken back to the future. This is head nod music with a difference. - \"Don't let the coked-out 80s cover fool you; this is a serious step forward”\n\nLone or Matt Cutler as he’s know to his Mum started out life making hard as hell bass beats with his mate Andy under the name ‘Kids In Tracksuits’. They did pretty good too, gaining support from Rob Da Bank, Steve Lamacq and Mary Anne Hobbs and touring all over the place. These days he has the likes of Flying Lotus, Samiyam, The Gaslamp Killer and Bob Ross are singing his praises and once you’ve checked out his new album ‘lemurian’ you’ll see why. Lone’s beats have charm, personality and a sound that can only be described as his own.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lone/Lemurian\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
