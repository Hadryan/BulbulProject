The song \"Black Tears\" is a cover, originally written by Dan Swanö for his band Edge of Sanity.\n\nThis album continues the band's tradition to record albums with Ahti Kortelainen at Tico-Tico Studio in Kemi, Finland. However, this is the first EToS album that Mikko Karmila mixed; before Chaotic Beauty all albums were also mixed by Ahti Kortelainen. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Tears+of+Sorrow/Chaotic+Beauty\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
