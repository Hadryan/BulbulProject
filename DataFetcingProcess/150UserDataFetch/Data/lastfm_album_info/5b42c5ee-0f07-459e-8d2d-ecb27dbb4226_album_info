House music that is delicately crafted from disco-ball shards. House music that filters vocals through space-age parabolics. House music that transcends the dancefloor and leaps into your eardrums. House music will never be the same, until he returns, again.\n\nPaper Tigers penetrates so deeply because the finer points of Delay’s sound are thrown at you with unrelenting vigor and rapidity; they attack like objects of blunt force while retaining the form and style that can only come from master craftsmanship. The overall experience is immediate and disarming. In a way it is showmanship taken to a musical extreme; Delay discards some incredible beats and melodies in a few bars that could lay the foundation for a truly epic dance tune. Imagine you are driving through a magical forest, and the trees have speakers that are blasting your favorite Luomo tracks. But every speaker is like a half second off the one before, and you’re driving really fast with the windows rolled down. That chopped, amazing, interesting sound you hear? That’s Paper Tigers. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Luomo/Paper+Tigers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
