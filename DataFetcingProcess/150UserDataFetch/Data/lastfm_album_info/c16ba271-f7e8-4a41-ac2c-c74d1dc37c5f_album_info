Imagine a castle with tons of rotted-out little rooms, each containing their own acoustics, etc. I refuse to record the next album in a building that does not at least look like a castle or a haunted mansion.

I wish we could record it on Halloween but we will be in Paris and we all know the buildings there are all brand new and look like the mixed use condos they are throwing up on my city's streets.
