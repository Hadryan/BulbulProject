Charles Hayward explained in a later interview, \"We had a firm belief that we were going to die, and the record was made on those terms.… The whole thing was designed to express this sort of fear, angst, which the group was all about really.\"  The album was intentionally given a violent, chaotic sound that proved to be an enourmous influence on later experimental bands.
