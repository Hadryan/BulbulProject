The album's first single, \"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\" was released to radio on July 15, 2011, three days earlier than expected due to the single leaking.\nRegarding the album, vocalist Anthony Kiedis noted, \"there is no question – this is a beginning,\" with drummer Chad Smith stating, \"this is a new band. Same name, but it's a new band.\", while Flea stated, \"it’s just like a very … meaningful and rejuvenating rebirth for us.\"\n\nTracklist\n1. \tMonarchy of Roses   \t4:11\n2. \tFactory of Faith   \t4:20\n3. \tBrendan's Death Song   \t5:38\n4. \tEthiopia   \t3:50\n5. \tAnnie Wants a Baby   \t3:40\n6. \tLook Around   \t3:28\n7. \tThe Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie   \t4:42\n8. \tDid I Let You Know   \t4:21\n9. \tGoodbye Hooray   \t3:52\n10. \tHappiness Loves Company   \t3:33\n11. \tPolice Station   \t5:35\n12. \tEven You Brutus?   \t4:01\n13. \tMeet Me at the Corner   \t4:21\n14. \tDance, Dance, Dance   \t3:45\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/I%27m+With+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
