Although most of the songs were initially recorded in January 1969 –before the recording of Abbey Road in September 1969– only Get Back and Don't Let Me Down were released on single later that April '69, and the rest of the recordings left unpublished due to The Beatles' busy schedule and personal difficulties in the band-/production-team.\nWhen The Beatles finally decided they would split up, the unreleased material was prepared for release with producer Phil Spector. He most prominently added the orchestral arrangement on The Long and Winding Road. Furthermore the legendary rooftop-recordings of Dig A Pony and Get Back, and the last ever Beatles studio recording –I Me Mine– were added to complete the set of tracks that would be released as The Last Beatles Album: Let It Be ...\nIn 2003 a not-produced-by-Phil-Spector reissue of Let It Be was published as  Let It Be... Naked under supervision of Paul McCartney featuring various alternate takes, and a more modest sound production. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Let+It+Be\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
