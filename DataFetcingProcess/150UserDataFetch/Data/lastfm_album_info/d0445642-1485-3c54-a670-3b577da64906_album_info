The 2-CD album was released on August 15, 2006 in the United States and Canada.\n\nIt features what Aguilera describes as \"a throwback to the 20s, 30s, and 40s-style jazz, blues, and feel-good soul music, but with a modern twist.\" The album has yielded three commercial worldwide singles: \"Ain't No Other Man\", \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\". Aguilera had two nominations for the Grammy Awards in the categories \"Best Pop Vocal Album\", \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\" (for \"Candyman\") and won the category of \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\" (for \"Ain't No Other Man\") in 2007.\n\nWhen Aguilera started working on Back to Basics, she was not just inspired by the sounds of the 1920s, '30s and '40s, but by the look of the era as well. When she began shooting for the artwork of the album, she cited Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, Judy Garland, Greta Garbo, Veronica Lake, among others as her inspirations.\n\nAguilera handpicked German photographer Ellen von Unwerth, who has captured Janet Jackson and Penelope Cruz, for the photo sessions. They spent three days beginning at a historic hotel called the Hollywood Dell. \n\nAguilera spent most of the first day in a bed, peering through the iron bars of a headboard, a shot inspired by a famous Marilyn Monroe picture. The Back to Basics cover shot, a sensual image that features her dressed in white and lounging on a bed, was taken during the same session. \n\nThe second day's shoot was a more dressed-up affair. Said the artist, \"A huge element also of this record is it's really fun and playful, with a 1920s circus theme.\" \n\nFor the third day, Aguilera and Unwerth went to Forty Deuce, a Hollywood hotspot that puts a modern twist on a 1920s burlesque club. For that shoot, they recreated the vibe of an old jazzy blues club. In the session, Aguilera also shot a series of pictures with four Navy sailors.\n\nThe 2-CD Back to Basics release comprises:\nBack To Basics (Disc 1)\nBack To Basics (Disc 2)\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Christina+Aguilera/Back+to+Basics\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
