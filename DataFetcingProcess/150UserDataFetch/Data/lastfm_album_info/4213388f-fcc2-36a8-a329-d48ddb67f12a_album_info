The title of the album was revealed on the band's website homepage.\n\niTunes leaked the album in the Australian and UK stores on September 16, 2006, over two weeks before the actual release date. After iTunes leaked the album, Shine On made its way onto file sharing sites through forums of similar bands and people shared that information with other people on Jet's MySpace page.\n\nOn September 23, 2006, Triple J premiered the album on its Music Specials show along with interviews with the band. A day later, Nova 100 played the entire album on the radio as a preview.\n\nThe album debuted at #3 on the Australian ARIA Albums chart the week of 8 October 2006 and became the fiftieth highest selling album for 2006. It has also gone platinum (70,000+ units shipped). It also debuted and peaked at number 13 on the Official UK Top 75 Albums Chart and 16 on the Billboard 200, but quickly fell out of the top 100 within four weeks.\n\nCritical reaction to the album was mixed; British music magazine NME, for instance, called the record \"another joyfully old-fashioned rock'n'roll album immersed in the classics,\" while the American review site Pitchfork Media posted a review containing only a video clip of a chimpanzee urinating into its own mouth. \n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jet/Shine+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
