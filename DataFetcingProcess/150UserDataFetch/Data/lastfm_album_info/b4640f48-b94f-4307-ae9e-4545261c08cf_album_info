After the band's original vocalist Dave Conway left in 1987, to be replaced by Bilinda Butcher, the band continued for a while in their previous noisy indie-pop style before Kevin Shields returned to their avant-garde roots, and began to explore the possibilities offered by the studio facilities available after signing to Creation Records in 1988. The first fruits of this experimentation was the single/EP \"You Made Me Realise\", released in July 1988, with Isn't Anything following later that year. Most of the album was recorded in a studio in Wales. While recording the album over a period of two weeks, the band got by on about two hours sleep a night. Bilinda Butcher described the effect of this on her vocals: \"Often, when we do the vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning: I've usually fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing. Maybe that's why it's languorous. I'm usually trying to remember what I've been dreaming about when I'm singing.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Isn%27t+Anything\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
