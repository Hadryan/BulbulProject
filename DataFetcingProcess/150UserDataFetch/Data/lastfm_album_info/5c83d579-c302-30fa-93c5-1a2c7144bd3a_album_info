Confield saw the experimental use of computer programs to form the basis of songs instead of stand-alone synthesizers. According to Booth, \"Most of Confield came out of experiments with Max that weren't really applicable in a club environment.\" One of the more controversial aspects of the album's production was, like EP7, the use of generative sequences for certain aspects of the songs. Booth countered this, arguing that although the beats created with the sequences may seem completely random to some people, that he and Brown had tight control over the limits and rules of what the beats could do, and that the concept was no different to the improvisation found in jazz. Although the bases of most of the songs were created by computers, analogue synthesizers and conventional drum machines were in fact used in many of the tracks.\nThe cover art for this release is a screenshot from a short animation created by Booth and Brown.\n\nPitchfork Media gave the album an 8.8/10, the highest they have ever rated an Autechre album, claiming that, \"For those willing to take these times in stride, Confield promises elegant production, accessibility in moderation, and one of the most enveloping, thought-provoking listening experiences to come forth from leftfield this year.\" \nHowever, Allmusic, giving the album only a 3/5, argued that Confield was \"a record to respect, not enjoy,\" a viewpoint expressed by other review outlets. \n\n\"Despite the dozens of experimental electronics producers constantly nipping at their heels, Autechre remained at the forefront of academic sound processing with a highly awaited sixth full album. Whether pushing the next new thing in 2001 is enough to keep listeners coming back to this LP years later is a much different question, and the assault of non-rhythmic beats sprayed all over Confield is enough to keep most from even trying. Opener \"VI Scose Poise\" is a bouncing-ball-in-a-ring-modulator production that reveals only a few of Autechre's excellent minor-key melodies, while the second off, \"Cfern,\" keeps listeners guessing as well with a parade of conflicting rhythms and head-spinning beats. In fact, it's a palpable relief when \"Cfern\" leads directly into more straightforward electro territory with \"Pen Expers.\" There are faint glimpses of the melancholy beauty of Autechre's early work, but this experimental, rigidly academic work is a record to respect, not enjoy.\" - Allmusic\n\nDespite the record's controversial nature, the album scores an average of 82/100 at Metacritic based on ten reviews, the highest average for any Autechre album on the site\n\nTrack listing:\n1.\t\"VI Scose Poise\"  \n2.\t\"Cfern\"  \n3.\t\"Pen Expers\"  \n4.\t\"Sim Gishel\"  \n5.\t\"Parhelic Triangle\" \n6.\t\"Bine\"  \n7.\t\"Eidetic Casein\"  \n8.\t\"Uviol\"  \n9.\t\"Lentic Catachresis\"  \n\nJapanese bonus track:\n10.\t\"MCR Quarter\" (Recorded live at Band On The Wall, Manchester 1998)\n  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Autechre/Confield\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
