In terms of chart positions, it was the most successful Cocteau Twins album, reaching No. 7 in the UK.\n\nDespite 4AD president Ivo Watts-Russell proclaiming it one of the best-ever releases on his label, he released the group from their contract at the end of 1990 because his relationship with the band had soured.\n\nThe album is noteworthy for the musical evolution that the band displayed at the time. The lyrics of vocalist Elizabeth Fraser were more intelligible; many concerned her newborn daughter Lucy Belle. \"Suddenly I had confidence which I'd never ever had in my life,\" Fraser said, \"which I consequently lost after I had the baby, because it's such a frightening experience you lose it again and you have to start over again. But it does change you.\".\n\nGuitarist Robin Guthrie was experiencing problems with drug addiction. As a result of his decreased time in the studio, bassist Simon Raymonde's playing was more in the forefront.\n\n\"We've had it in the back of our mind that we wanted to play live again,\" said Guthrie at the time of the album's release, \"so we thought we'd make some of the pieces more like songs we could actually play live… We like it better than all our last records. That's why we continue to make more – because if we made the perfect record we'd sit back and say, 'We can't do any better than that.' We think all our other ones are fucking crap. I'm slightly proud of a couple of tracks on a couple of them, but essentially I'm really embarrassed about what we've done in the past…\".\n\nThe album has received positive critical acclaim. \"Heaven or Las Vegas is their finest hour yet,\" enthused Martin Aston in Q. \"Ten exquisite moments that make Kate Bush – their only possible comparison – sound as airborne as Motörhead.\" The album subsequently featured in the magazine's \"best of the year\" roundup: \"The Cocteaus continue on their inimitable course, blissfully regardless of what's going on in the world outside their surreal reality.\"\n\n\"You may be able to dig out some of the words,\" wrote Andrew Perry in Select, \"you may even get to hear some of the songs live, but Heaven Or Las Vegas is Cocteau Twins in their usual, spectacular and enigmatic context.\"[10] \"In times when every other pop group is dragging on board whatever chemicals, '60s techniques and hypno-rhythms they can grab in order to achieve the desirable blissed-out condition,\" said Roger Morton in Vox, \"it's a good joke that the Cocteaus can get there with such apparent effortlessness.\"'[13]\n\nIt was listed as the 90th best album of the 1990s by Pitchfork Media, who complimented Fraser's more direct vocals and the album's complex songwriting.[14] The album was also included in the 2008 edition of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die,[15] and in The Guardian's online edition of a similar list.[16] It was considered the band's strongest work since Treasure by AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett, who described it as \"simply fantastic\" and successful in creating \"more accessibility\".[2]\n\nHeaven or Las Vegas was named by NME as the 28th best album of 1990.[17] Retrospectively, The Observer listed the album as the 97th greatest British album ever made.[18] <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cocteau+Twins/Heaven+or+Las+Vegas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
