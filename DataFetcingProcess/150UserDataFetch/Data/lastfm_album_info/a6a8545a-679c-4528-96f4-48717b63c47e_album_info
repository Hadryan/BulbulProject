To that end, Slagel financed a recording budget (Show No Mercy was paid for by band members) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio.\n\nLyrical themes on Hell Awaits are darker than on Show No Mercy, and included hell and Satan. Musically, the album features the band's most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous releases. Defined as \"influential to future extreme metal acts,\" the most popular songs from Hell Awaits were re-recorded by various underground metal bands and have appeared on several tribute albums. Musicians such as singer Phil Anselmo and drummer Gene Hoglan cite Hell Awaits as an influence. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Slayer/Hell+Awaits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
