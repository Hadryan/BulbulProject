Lately, though, he’s high-stepped hard into the zeitgeist, leading major-label refugee collaborators like Solange and Sky Ferreira to breezy cool-pop stardom. And later this fall, he’ll release Cupid Deluxe, his second Blood Orange album and his first since his production helped change the sound of the indie mainstream. We’ve already heard the absolutely lovely first track “Chamakay,” which had backing vocals from Chairlift’s Caroline Polachek. And now he’s announced all the details of Cupid Deluxe, which will also feature contributions from Dirty Projectors leader Dave Longstreth, cloud-rap impressario Clams Casino, hard-barking rapper Despot, Friends’ Samantha Urbani, Kindness mastermind Adam Bainbridge, grime rapper Skepta, and others. Check out the tracklist below. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Orange/Cupid+Deluxe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
