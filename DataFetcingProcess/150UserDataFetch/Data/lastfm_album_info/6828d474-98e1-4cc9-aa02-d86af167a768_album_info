Beginning on March 31, a Warm Digits remix of \"Natural Selection\" was made available for download to customers who had pre-ordered \"Where Did the Night Fall\" on UNKLE's online store.[11]\n\nAvailable on the UNKLE website was a 2 disc limited edition of the album, which included a second disc containing instrumental versions of all the songs.\n\n Where Did The Night Fall - Another Night Out\n\nOn February 9th, UNKLE revealed that \"Where Did The Night Fall\" would be re-released as \"Where Did the Night Fall - Another Night Out\".

It's currently set for a release on April 11th.\n\nThe standard edition comes packaged as a double jewel case with a 16 page booklet.
