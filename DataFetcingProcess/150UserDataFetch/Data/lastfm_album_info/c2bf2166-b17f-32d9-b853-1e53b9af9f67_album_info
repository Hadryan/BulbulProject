This is the first of what would be a series of projects with Maile, and members of the band commented at the time about finding the right producer. Whereas the band had previously had an input at the mixing stage, Maile took sole responsibility here, Clarke explaining that the result was that \"you can finally hear everything that's going on\".\n\nOf the performances, Lemmy claimed that \"Vic got me singing instead of just shouting all the time\", while Taylor added \"and he got me playing more solid\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead/Ace+of+Spades\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
