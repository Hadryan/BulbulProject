It was released on July 27, 1984 by Megaforce Records. It was re-released in the same year on November 19 by Elektra records. In the United States alone Ride The Lightning has sold over 5 million copies.\n\nRide the Lightning is often hailed by fans as a classic of the thrash metal genre and a vital bridge between the band's albums Kill 'Em All and Master of Puppets, pushing the thrash metal of the debut into progressive territory more fully-realized on \"Master of Puppets\" and \"...And Justice for All.\"\n\nRide the Lightning retains the speed of Kill 'Em All on songs like \"Trapped Under Ice\" and \"Fight Fire with Fire\", but also contains the first of Metallica's longer, more intricate tracks, such as \"Fade to Black\" and the nearly 9-minute closing instrumental \"The Call of Ktulu\". \"Ride the Lightning\" is the last Metallica album to credit Dave Mustaine.\n\nRide the Lightning was listed at #3 on a list compiled by metal-rules.com of the Top 100 Metal Albums of All Time and #5 by IGN Music on the Top 25 Metal Albums. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Ride+the+Lightning\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
