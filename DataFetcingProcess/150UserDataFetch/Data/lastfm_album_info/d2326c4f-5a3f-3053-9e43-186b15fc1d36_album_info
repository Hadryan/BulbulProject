Britpop era, the album became the band's most successful release when it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and subsequently gained platinum status for sales of album, which reached over a million copies worldwide and 500,000 in the UK.\n\nTitle:\nThe title of the album is cockney rhyming slang for \"I should think so''. (Rhyming slang is a form of phrase construction in the English language).\n\nCover art: \nThe front cover of the album is a painting based on three separate photos of Coombes, Goffey, and Quinn. The portraits of Coombes and Goffey were taken by Quinn in the summer of 1994 when he was experimenting with a macro lens. The photo of Quinn was taken that same year by a friend, while they were on tour in Wolverhampton. The painting was then created by the Moody Painters. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Supergrass/I+Should+Coco\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
