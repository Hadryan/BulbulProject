The album reached no.3 in the UK.\n\nIn November 1995, to cash in on the band's renewed success at that time, Virgin repackaged the hits collection with a new cover and added newer tracks: \"Tell Me When\" (from the Octopus album) and a new remix of the band's biggest hit \"Don't You Want Me\" by German-American electronic music group Snap!. In addition to this, a brand new track, \"Stay with Me Tonight\", was included which the band had recorded under their new recording contract with EastWest Records. This would later be released as a single. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Human+League/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
