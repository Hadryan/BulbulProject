It reached #1 in the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of just under 238,000, becoming the 9th fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album entered the U.S. charts at #12, with 65,000 albums sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album has reached there since 1997 with Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief. Don't Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the U.K. in the first week of 2006, and in the U.S. has gone to sell over 200,000 units. As of June 2008, Don't Believe the Truth has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.\n\nEvery member of the band contributed to the writing of tracks for the album, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey, who replaced Oasis' longtime member Alan White.\n\nLiam also had a larger impact on the album by his developing songwriting. Noel has said that this album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members have contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel to a typically Noel-written Oasis album.\n\nThe band embarked on a massive world-wide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 2 million people. This resulted in the making of Lord Don't Slow Me Down, a film later released on DVD. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Don%27t+Believe+the+Truth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
