It was released in the UK on 16 March 2009, with the single \"Last of the English Roses\" preceding it by one week. The album features contributions from Blur guitarist Graham Coxon (who plays guitar on all the songs on the album apart from “Broken Love Song\") Dot Allison, Peter Wolfe (aka Wolfman), and members of Babyshambles. Most of the songs have been played live or feature in demo form on leaked sessions.\n\nFollowing famous stints in Babyshambles and The Libertines, Doherty began to play various solo shows throughout the UK. His biggest came on 12 July 2008, where Doherty played a solo gig at the Royal Albert Hall. It was his biggest solo show ever but the solo show wasn't received well. According to the critics \"whole chunks of the set passed by as listless noodling, with neither Doherty nor the audience appearing to know quite how to behave\". The consensus was that - without a full band - Doherty seemed out of place at such a big venue.\nHowever, on 13 January 2009, NME.COM announced that Doherty's solo album, entitled Grace/Wastelands would be released on 16 March, preceded by a single, \"Last of the English Roses\", on 9 March. The website also revealed the tracklisting of the album and credits.\n\n\nThe original tracklisting included \"Through The Looking Glass\" but it was replaced by \"I Am The Rain\" due to it fitting the vibe of the album more. \"Glass\" ended up as a B-side to \"Last of the English Roses.\" A preliminary tracklist for the album also included \"Darksome Sea\", a song co-written and recorded with Peter Wolfe in Summer 2008, however the song did not end up on the album. Also, the song \"1939 Returning\" was originally planned to be a duet with Amy Winehouse.\nThe album was released to positive reviews, despite only reaching #17 in the UK.\n\n\nInitial critical response to Grace/Wastelands was positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 74, based on 22 reviews.[3]\nThough critics were a lot more fond of the record than Doherty's last two efforts, the album did not sell as well as was expected, particularly in the UK - peaking only at 17 in the UK Top 40. However, Q stated that the album was impressive, awarding it 4/5 and stating the album \"demolishes the charge that his talent has been fatally squandered\" although it did state it isn't the \"defining statement\" of genius his fans insist is round the corner.\nSimilarly, The Observer newspaper gave the album positive reviews, stating that the album said \"goodbye to Pete Libertine the Rehab King, and say hello to Peter Doherty, outstanding singer-songwriter and charismatic poet-vagabond. It's a pleasure finally to meet him.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Doherty/Grace%2FWastelands\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
