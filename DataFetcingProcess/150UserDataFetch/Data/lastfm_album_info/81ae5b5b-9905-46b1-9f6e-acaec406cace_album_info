It was released 26 June 2012 via Roadrunner Records. The album received universal acclaim from music critics. The album sold almost over 11,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 34 on The Billboard 200 chart, when band's previous CD, \"The Way of All Flesh\", opened with 4,200 units back in 2008 to land at No. 138.\n\nL'Enfant Sauvage is inspired by François Truffaut's film of the same name which tells the true story of Victor of Aveyron, a child who was found alone in the woods with behaviors closer to a wild animal than a civilized human.\n\nFrontman, guitarist and songwriter Joe Duplantier talks about the meaning of the album by saying, “When you become a musician, you don’t have a boss telling you what to do so you have to be very responsible.” He goes on to say “With freedom comes responsibility, so I’m asking myself, ‘What is freedom? What does it mean to me?’ L’Enfant Sauvage reflects on that. There’s no answer though. There’s just life and questions.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gojira/L%27Enfant+Sauvage\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
