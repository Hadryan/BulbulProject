Most of the songs began as instrumental jams, to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness, and abuse.\n\nTen was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The album produced three hit singles: \"Alive\", \"Even Flow\", and \"Jeremy\". While Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time, Ten was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the mainstream. The album has been certified twelve times Platinum in the United States and remains Pearl Jam's most successful album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/Ten\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
