It was also issued in the United Kingdom on Philips Records in 1972. Recording sessions for the album took place at RCA Studios in New York City on April 19 and 20 in 1971. The album serves as the follow-up to Scott-Heron's live debut album, Small Talk at 125th and Lenox (1970), and it features compositions by Scott-Heron that were recorded in a more conventional song structure rather than the spoken word style of his previous work.\n\nThe album marked the first of several future collaborations by Scott-Heron with musician Brian Jackson. It is one of Scott-Heron's most critically acclaimed albums and one of the Flying Dutchman label's best-selling LP's. Earning modest success upon its release, Pieces of a Man has since received retrospective notice and praise from critics. Music writers have noted Scott-Heron's and Jackson's musical fusion of soul, jazz-funk, and proto-rap styles on the album and its influence on subsequent dance and hip hop music. The album was reissued on compact disc by RCA Records in 1993.\n\nBefore pursuing a recording career, Scott-Heron focused on a writing career. He published a volume of poetry and his first novel, The Vulture, in 1970.Subsequently, Scott-Heron was encouraged by jazz producer Bob Thiele to record and released a live album, Small Talk at 125th and Leno It was inspired a volume of poetry of the same name and was well received by music critics.\n\nPieces of a Man was recorded at RCA Studios in New York City on April 19 and 20 in 1971.The album's first four tracks were written by Scott-Heron, and the last seven tracks were co-written by Scott-Heron and keyboardist Brian Jackson, who backs Scott-Heron with Pretty Purdie & the Playboys.The album was produced by Thiele, who was known for working with jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong and John Coltrane. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gil+Scott-Heron/Pieces+of+a+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
