The single, \"Bird Has Flown\" didn't impress the audience either. Shortly after the album was released in the US, and even before the UK audience could buy it, Rod Evans and Nick Simper were both fired when their limitations became evident to the other members.\n\nIn 2000, the CD was re-issued along with extensive liner notes and 5 bonus tracks.\n\nIt was the last album to feature the so-called Mark I of Deep Purple, that included:\n\nRod Evans - vocals\nRitchie Blackmore - guitar\nNick Simper - bass guitar, backing vocals\nJon Lord - Hammond organs, keyboard, backing vocals\nIan Paice - drums <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple/Deep+Purple\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
