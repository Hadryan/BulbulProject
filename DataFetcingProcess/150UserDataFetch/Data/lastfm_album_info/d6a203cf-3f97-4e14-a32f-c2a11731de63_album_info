'Saudade' is a Portuguese word that describes the deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for a lover, also called the 'love that remains' once someone is gone.\n\nThe album features many guest artists, with each track sung by one of the five female guest vocalists (LouLou Ghelichkhani, Karina Zeviani, Elin Melgarejo, Natalia Clavier and Shana Halligan). It also features U.N.K.L.E. drummer Michael Lowery, Argentine singer/songwriter Federico Aubele, and Brazilian percussionist Roberto Santos in what can be described as a mesmerizing compilation of songs.\n\nThe duo seem to have gone for a more melancholic, wistful sound to the album, with each song flowing like a soft summer breeze. The female vocals are refreshing and relaxing at the same time, and the softer, warmer beats of the songs are a welcome break from what is commonly heard on electronic music records in recent times.\n\nAccording to the band, “It’s a bit of a departure for us, but at the same time these are our roots, this is what brought us together. It’s us coming full circle from electronic music back to something organic before we move on to our next chapter.” Their experiments with Bossa Nova seem to have paid off in the form of this great album, which both surprises, and delights the listener. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thievery+Corporation/Saudade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
