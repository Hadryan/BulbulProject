It was recorded at the Drugstore in 1991 and released on March 23, 1992 on Blanco y Negro Records. The title refers to one of the band's early hits, \"Just Like Honey\", and is intended to demonstrate a complete departure from their earlier musical style.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Reverence\", attracted some controversy for the lyrics \"I want to die just like Jesus Christ\", and \"I want to die just like JFK\". Banned by Top of the Pops, the track peaked at #10 in the UK charts and received airplay in the United States on alternative radio stations.\n\nHoney's Dead was recorded in the band's London studio, the aptly named \"Drugstore\", with accomplished engineer Flood and future JaMC producer Alan Moulder on board (not to mention a considerably larger bankroll).\n\nAlternative and campus radio stations picked up \"Far Gone and Out\" which remains one of the band's most popular singles to date, peaking at #23 in the band's native UK. The Mary Chain shared the bill during parts of Lollapalooza 1992 in the U.S. with Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Ministry, Lush, Ice Cube and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anheuser Busch even used the samples of \"Sugar Ray\" as a background bed for their Bud Ice television commercials in 1993.\n\nHoney's Dead was on the short list of nominees for the 1992 Mercury Prize. The album posts a close second in sales to (1994) release Stoned & Dethroned (which contains the hit single \"Sometimes Always\" with Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star). The Reid brothers alternate between singing duties on tracks (most likely coinciding with songwriting duties).\n\nPersonnel\nJim Reid - vocals (tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8), guitar, producer\nWilliam Reid - vocals (tracks 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12), guitar, producer\nSteve Monti - drums, percussion\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jesus+and+Mary+Chain/Honey%27s+Dead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
