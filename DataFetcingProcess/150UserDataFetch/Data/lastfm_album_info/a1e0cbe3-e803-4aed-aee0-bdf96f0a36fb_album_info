All songs were written and produced by Sparro and Jesse Rogg, except for \"Waiting For Time\" and \"Hot Mess\" which Sparro wrote together with Eg White; and \"Pocket\" and \"Can't Stop This\", which the artist wrote with Paul Epworth. This electronic album is a refreshing mixture of electrofunk, pop, soul and house. Sam's sultry voice at times resembles Prince, the male pop icon of the 80s. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Sparro/Sam+Sparro\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
