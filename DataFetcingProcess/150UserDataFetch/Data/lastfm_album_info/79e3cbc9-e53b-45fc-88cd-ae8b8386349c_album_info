It was released on November 22, 2005, six months after the release of companion album Mezmerize.\n\nThe album was released on both CD and DualDisc; the latter contains behind-the-scenes footage showing the making of Mezmerize and Hypnotize, the music videos for the songs \"B.Y.O.B.\" and \"Question!\", and the entire album in enhanced stereo (LPCM at 16-bit/48KHz versus the CD standard of 16-bit/44.1KHz). The album case was printed with soy inks on recycled paper. Inside the booklet the words, \"We don't have to cut forests to make paper anymore.\" can be read.\n\nThe artwork is by guitarist/singer Daron Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian. The packaging for Hypnotize is specially designed to physically join Mezmerize and Hypnotize together, forming one unified product with continuous artwork. The additional panel on the Hypnotize slots into the inside of the Mezmerize digipak case, which opens on the left side instead of the right.\n\nAccording to bassist Shavo Odadjian, the album was originally set to open with an instrumental track called \"Hezze,\" but was instead dropped entirely in favor of beginning with \"Attack.\" \"We wanted to start out the album really heavy,\" Odadjian explained. It is expected that \"Hezze\" will be released sometime in the future on an EP.\n\nThe last track on Hypnotize, \"Soldier Side\" completes \"Soldier Side - Intro\", which appears as the opening track on Mezmerize. In addition to this, the song \"Lonely Day\" (which plays right before Soldier Side) has the same ending as \"Soldier Side - Intro\".\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Daron Malakian – vocals, guitar\n    * Serj Tankian – vocals, keyboard\n    * Shavo Odadjian – bass\n    * John Dolmayan – drums\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/Hypnotize\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
