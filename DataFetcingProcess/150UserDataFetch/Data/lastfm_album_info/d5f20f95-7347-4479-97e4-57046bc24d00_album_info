Unlike his previous two solo albums, \"Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt \"and \"Smile from the Streets You Hold\", the record features Frusciante exploring elements of electronica, synthpop and New Wave. It was recorded subsequent to his heroin addiction. Following a month in rehab for his addiction and his rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante felt deeply connected to the spiritual plane and is quoted as saying that this album was inspired by the many visions he had of spirits during this time. The lyrics express this theme and deal mostly with philosophical and spiritual matters as well as delving into his usual brand of psychedelia-tinged personalism. It reached #30 on Heatseekers. Vincent Gallo directed a video for every track on the record. Murderers is featured in the segment Invisible Boards of the skateboarding home video Yeah Right!.\n\nFrusciante's main influences for this album were 1980s synthpop, post-punk and electronica bands like Depeche Mode and New Order, bands that did all of their own programming.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Frusciante/To+Record+Only+Water+For+Ten+Days\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
