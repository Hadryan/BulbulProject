It was released on the 28th February 2000. It  received mixed reviews by professionals. This is the first album from Oasis which doesn't feature two of Oasis' founding members, Bonehead and Guigsy. This album lacks the usual optimism, which usually heard in Oasis' songs. It even sometimes has a quite depressing sound, on songs like \"Where Did It All Go Wrong\" and \"Sunday Morning Call\".\nWe can, however, consider this album as the most experimental. It has drum loops, backwards guitar, electric sitar and more. Songs like \"Go Let It Out\" are a departure from the usual Oasis style, while \"Fuckin' In The Bushes\" is considered to be the Oasis song which is most influenced by older hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin. The album was released on the Big Brother label, the bands own. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Standing+on+the+Shoulder+of+Giants\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
