The album's title is a play on the Dwight Yoakam album Hillbilly Deluxe. Zombie's debut effort met with considerable success and featured numerous popular singles, in particular, \"Dragula\" and \"Living Dead Girl.\"\n\nThe album features the heavy guitar/bass and twisted, often violent horror themes of White Zombie, but it also reveals elements unique to Rob Zombie's solo career. For example, songs often feature a more danceable groove and electronic sounds/vocal overdubbing. In October 1999, Rob Zombie released a Hellbilly Deluxe remix album, American Made Music to Strip By.\n\nOn September 14th 2009 it was announced that Rob Zombie would embark on the Hellbilly Deluxe 2 Tour, which is in support of his forthcoming album \"Hellbilly Deluxe 2: Noble Jackals, Penny Dreadfuls and the Systematic Dehumanization of Cool\" which is stated to be a companion to the original album as per his website. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Zombie/Hellbilly+Deluxe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
