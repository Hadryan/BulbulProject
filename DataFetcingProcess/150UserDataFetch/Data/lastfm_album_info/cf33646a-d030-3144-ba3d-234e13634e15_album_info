The songs \"My Own Summer (Shove It)\" and \"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\" were both released as singles with accompanying videos.\n\nAround the Fur is the album that put Deftones at the forefront of the 1990s alternative metal scene, after the underground, fan-base building success of their major label debut, Adrenaline.\n\nThe song \"Headup\" features Max Cavalera of Soulfly. The song was written by Max and Chino as a way of venting some of their pain over the loss of Max's step son, and Chino's friend, Dana Wells. Soulfly is taken from a portmanteau invented for the song.\n\nAround the Fur, is the first album to feature Frank Delgado as additional personnel, who would eventually join the band officially in 1999.\n\nLhabia and Dai the Flu are often mislabeled as \"ihabia\" and \"Dai Th Flu\" respectively. The correct titles are as they appear in the track listing below. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/Around+the+Fur\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
