Around 25 to 30 songs were recorded in 2006,[2]  with 13 of these appearing on the final track list. The album is named after the town of Cassadaga, Florida, a community of mediums and followers of spiritualism.\n\nZ Berg of the Like, Sherri DuPree and Stacy DuPree of Eisley as well as solo artist Rachael Yamagata all appear on this album. The first single, \"Four Winds\" was released on March 6, 2007, from the Four Winds EP with five B-sides not on Cassadaga.\n\nCassadaga debuted at number four on the U.S Billboard 200, selling about 58,000 copies in its first week.[4] The album is the 103rd release of Saddle Creek Records. This album was #12 on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007.\n\nJohnny Depp named Cassadaga one of his \"favorite things\" of 2007.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Four Winds\" can be heard in the background briefly during the party scene in the 2008 film Cloverfield.\n\nCover\n\nThe CD and LP versions of the album come with a \"Spectral Decoder\" which allows users to see the true cover art on the album. One particular segment of text located on the back of the case includes a phrase in Russian; \"тяните другую кровавую ванну\" meaning \"draw another bloody bath\", a reference to the first track's lyrics. Another hidden phrase is in Greek; \"παρελθόν παρουσιάζω μέλλον\" meaning \"the past presents the future\", which is also the title of an album by Her Space Holiday, with whom Bright Eyes released a split single.\n\nHidden phrases in English:\n\n    * \"Dog faced apologists pleasing themselves on the burning sand\"\n    * \"These myths are sacred and profane!\"\n    * \"Rocks beneath the water\" (Which is what \"Cassadaga\" means in the Seneca language.)\n    * \"Citrus slaves throwing dice in the dirt, amusement\"\n    * \"We love you, Breezy, and we miss you!!!\" (One can only assume that this is a dedication to Sabrina Duim - see below.)\n    * \"Swollen saints bathing in a backwards river under a sliver of a moon\"\n    * \"Mighty Saturn enters your eighth house\"\n\nHidden phrases in French:\n\n    * \"Est-ce minuit ou midi?\" (\"Is it midnight or noon?\")\n\nHidden phrases in Portuguese:\n\n    * \"Virgens doentes de sol ficando frescas no túmulo do faraó\" (\"Virgins sick from the sun staying fresh in the grave of Pharaoh\")\n    * \"Plantas de pirâmedes cheio de cores tatuado na barriga de uma puta\" (\"Pyramide blueprints, full of colours, tattooed in the belly of a whore\")\n\n\"For Sabrina\" is written on the inside of the CD case in memory of Sabrina Duim, a harpist and Stanford University undergraduate who toured with Bright Eyes and died in January 2007.\n\nOn the back of the UK standard edition, \"If the Brakeman Turns My Way\" is misprinted as \"If the Breakman Turns My Way\". This UK standard edition was modified by designers at Polydor/Universal from the U.S. release (digipak, equivalent to the UK deluxe version).\n\nOn February 10, 2008, Cassadaga won a Grammy award for Best Recording Package.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Conor Oberst, except where noted.\n\n   1. \"Clairaudients (Kill or Be Killed)\" – 6:08\n   2. \"Four Winds\" – 4:16\n   3. \"If the Brakeman Turns My Way\" (Conor Oberst and Jason Boesel) – 4:53\n   4. \"Hot Knives\" – 4:13\n   5. \"Make a Plan to Love Me\" – 4:14\n   6. \"Soul Singer in a Session Band\" – 4:14\n   7. \"Classic Cars\" – 4:19\n   8. \"Middleman\" – 4:49\n   9. \"Cleanse Song\" – 3:28\n  10. \"No One Would Riot for Less\" – 5:12\n  11. \"Coat Check Dream Song\" (Conor Oberst and Nate Walcott) – 4:10\n  12. \"I Must Belong Somewhere\" – 6:19\n  13. \"Lime Tree\" – 5:53\n\nB-sides\n\nB-side \tAvailability\n\"Tourist Trap\" \tFour Winds\n\"Reinvent the Wheel\" \tFour Winds\n\"Cartoon Blues\" \tFour Winds\n\"Smoke Without Fire\" \tFour Winds\n\"Stray Dog Freedom\" \tFour Winds\n\"Endless Entertainment\" \tDownload here\n\"Susan Miller Rag\" \t3\" (8 cm) with Cassadaga pre-order\n\n\"Susan Miller Rag\" is a B-side to the album.
