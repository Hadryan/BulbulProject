Not reduction, but expansion. If there’s anything “micro” in Vocalcity, it’s the way tiny little holes open up within the frizzing chords, as though you could see the pixels framing each fraying waveform. But that’s all academic. Years later, “minimal” techno has fattened itself up again. Most of today’s rave hits don’t sound anything like Luomo, but I don’t think anything today would sound the way it does if Luomo hadn’t seduced the tinkerers away from their mouse pads and back to the land of goosebumps and sex. What you hear most in Luomo today are the stomach-punching bass lines, the pistoning chords inherited straight from Chicago’s finest, and those maddeningly ambiguous vocals, always hovering just out of reach. Perhaps the long exception is the male refrain in “Synkro”, which could stand as the tautological epigraph to the album’s simple brilliance: “because you move / the way you move.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Luomo/Vocalcity\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
