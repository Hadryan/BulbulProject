It was released as a single that same year in many countries, but not in the United Kingdom or the United States. The song was written, primarily by Paul McCartney, around the time that highlife and reggae were beginning to become popular in Britain. The tag line \"ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra\" was an expression that Nigerian conga player Jimmy Scott-Emuakpor, an acquaintance of McCartney, used. The song is in the key of B flat and written in 4/4. During May 1968, the Beatles gathered at George Harrison's Esher home, in Surrey, to record demos for their upcoming project. \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" was one of the twenty-seven demos recorded there. Paul performed this demo solo, with only an acoustic guitar. He had also double-tracked his vocal, which was not perfectly synchronised, creating an echoing effect. According to studio engineer Geoff Emerick, John Lennon openly hated the song, calling it \"Paul's granny shit\".[1] After leaving the studio during recording of the song (after several days and literally dozens of takes of the song, trying different tempos and styles), Lennon returned while under the influence of marijuana, went immediately to the piano and played the opening chords much louder and faster than they had been played before. He claimed that was how the song should be played, and this is the version they ended up using.[2] <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Ob-La-Di,+Ob-La-Da\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
