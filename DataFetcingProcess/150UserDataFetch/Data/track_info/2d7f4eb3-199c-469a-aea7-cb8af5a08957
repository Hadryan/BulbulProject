She started out in Texas, singing the blues.  She recalls the pain and loneliness of growing up an \"outsider\" in several published interviews and quotes. \nIn the very early 60's, you would find Big Brother and the Holding Company playing free concerts in 19th Street Park, better known as Golden Gate Park.  Janis would be singing her heart out, back then \"Pig Pen\" was playing drums, (I think he was 1st drummer for band).  \nShe sang from within herself.  A voice, while deep, was very moving and intense, a part of her coming out only in song. She was a free spirit, a very young woman looking for love and acceptance.  \nShe wanted to sing when she felt like singing, that is where the \"song\" comes from, the wanting to share through voice the things she could not share through common communication. Music became business instead of her \"feelings\" and her art.  Gone was the freedom to roam, to find the motivation that was needed to make her want to \"sing\". It became appointments, deadlines, deals about money and what the \"public\" wanted. Janis the beautiful songbird had been caged by her fame. She drank too much to fill the loneliness, took drugs for the same reason.  She just wanted to sing and to be loved.\nJanis Joplin was a small town girl with a huge voice and heart to match.  All she ever wanted was one man, one good man to love her.  She would be alive today if she had found him. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Janis+Joplin/_/Summertime\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
