Winehouse performed the song live at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 in Munich, Germany, on 1 November 2007.\n\n\"Amy's sultry new video for Back In Black [sic] is both beautifully and artistically shot in black and white and compares in imagery a doomed love affair with that of a funeral.\"\nThe music video features a funeral procession in which Winehouse mourns over a grave, which reads \"R.I.P. the Heart of Amy Winehouse\". The graveyard scenes were filmed at Abney Park Cemetery and other scenes were filmed in nearby Gibson Gardens and Chesholm Road, also in Stoke Newington, London.\n\nPre-release, the song charted in the UK Singles Chart on downloads alone for five consecutive weeks, peaking at number forty. The single charted at number twenty-five once it had been released in physical format, and has sold around 96,000 copies to date in the UK; it has spent thirty-four non-consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart to date. It has re-entered with \"Rehab\" together on the chart. The song featured on BBC Radio 1's The B List Playlist during the week commencing 2 May. Channel 4 Music awarded the song ten stars out of ten in its review, while Manchester Evening News rated the song as five out of five stars, commending it as \"one of the best singles of the year.\"\n\nWith sales of 96,000, \"Back to Black\" finished as the UK's eighty-fifth biggest-selling single of 2007.\n\nThe title track from Amy's Award Winning album, 'Back To Black' oozes Blues and proves beyond any doubt what a remarkable talent la Winehouse is. It's been quite a year for Amy, she's been nominated for (and won) multiple awards and has also recently tied the knot! <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Winehouse/_/Back+to+Black\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
