While it wasn't released on any of their studio albums, it was included in the track listing of their compilations: The Singles, The Story of the Clash, Volume 1, Singles Box, The Singles (2007) and Clash on Broadway.\n\n\"This Is Radio Clash\", like their previous single \"The Magnificent Seven\", is a dub reggae, rap, punk-funk song that was influenced by old school hip hop acts from New York City, like the Sugarhill Gang and Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five.\n\nAmerican critic Eric Schafer cites \"This is Radio Clash\"/\"Radio Clash\" as the first ever British hip hop song and notes, \"It is a magnificent, daring, challenging record that was years ahead of its time; one of the great rock records of the 1980s, it has never been given its just credit. Twenty-eight years after its debut, were it released today it would still burn up the radio.\"\n\nThe first public performance of the song was on Tom Snyder's Tomorrow show in 1981.\n\nThe B-side of the \"This Is Radio Clash\" single is titled simply \"Radio Clash.\" It is the same recording as the A-side, but with a different remix and changes to the lyrics. The theme of the lyrics is the same, yet the actual lyrics are in fact different. The Clash stated at the time that they intended the songs to be heard as a single entity. However, the two tracks are really variations on the same 4 minute recording and have exactly the same length. Some fans concluded that the two tracks are edits of a longer 8 minute recording, but this is incorrect.\n\nThe similarities of the A and B side recordings has led to quite a bit of confusion not only by fans but by record companies as well. On the remastered version of the Super Black Market Clash CD, which assembles Clash B-sides, remixes and rarities, the B-side \"Radio Clash\" is included, but incorrectly listed as \"This Is Radio Clash.\" The same error was repeated on the 2003 collection The Essential Clash. Finally in 2006 Singles Box was released which collates the 12\"'s tracks in the same order, allowing the two tracks to be heard side by side once again for the first time since the original 1981 single release. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash/_/This+is+Radio+Clash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
