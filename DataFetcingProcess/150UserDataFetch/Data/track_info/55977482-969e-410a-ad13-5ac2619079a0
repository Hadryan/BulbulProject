The song is written and sung by Noel Gallagher, who took over lead vocal from brother Liam Gallagher  on an A-side for the first time since Don't Look Back in Anger in 1996.\n\nThough the song has the same anthemic feel that popularised many Oasis songs, and departs from the psychedelic feel of Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, which had been poorly received by critics, it received a mixed critical reception.\n\nThe music video is a take on the Jack Nicholson film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, with characters resembling McMurphy and Nurse Ratched. It was filmed in an old mental institution in Vancouver, Canada and features Scottish actor James Cunningham, who has previously starred in the original play of Trainspotting. \nUnlike the film, the video begins with the McMurphy character escaping his home and giving chase to the authorities, and ends in a football match. While the inmates celebrate a victory, Oasis are seen watching from the asylum window, and Noel Gallagher makes a 'wanker' hand gesture at Cunningham.\nAlthough unconfirmed, there was widespread speculation at the time that the song was inspired by Noel's friend Kate Moss.\n\n\"Sunday Morning Call\" was the first Oasis single to feature Noel on lead vocals on all the songs, frontman Liam did not perform on any of the songs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Sunday+Morning+Call\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
