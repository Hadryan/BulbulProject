Unlike the album version where a keyboard and bass melody is present throughout the entire chorus, the live version typically omits the melody for the first half of the chorus. The ending of the song is extended when performed live and is often concluded with Reznor screaming \"you fuckin' promised me,\" followed by a brief sample of the words \"will you forgive me?\"\n\nSong Credits\n\n    * Production: Flood, Trent Reznor\n    * Engineering: Flood, John Fryer, Doug de Angelis\n    * Mix: John Fryer, Trent Reznor  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/_/Terrible+Lie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
