And I thought ... that's how simple the act of procreation is ... We have horrendous problems with it, and yet animals don't.''\n\nLennon was unhappy that McCartney recorded the song without him. In his 1980 interview with Playboy, he said:\n\nPlayboy: \"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\"\nLennon: That's Paul. He even recorded it by himself in another room. That's how it was getting in those days. We came in and he'd made the whole record. Him drumming. Him playing the piano. Him singing. But he couldn't—he couldn't—maybe he couldn't make the break from the Beatles. I don't know what it was, you know. I enjoyed the track. Still, I can't speak for George, but I was always hurt when Paul would knock something off without involving us. But that's just the way it was then.\nPlayboy: You never just knocked off a track by yourself?\nLennon: No.\nPlayboy: \"Julia\"?\nLennon: That was mine <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Why+Don%27t+We+Do+It+in+the+Road%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
