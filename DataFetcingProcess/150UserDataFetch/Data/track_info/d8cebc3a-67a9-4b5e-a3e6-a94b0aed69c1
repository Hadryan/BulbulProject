It was included in Guitar World's list of the 100 greatest guitar solos of all time, voted in at number 54. Ironically, in the album version and following live performances of the song, the solo was much shortened compared to the original demo, and even was considered to be dropped, as Corgan felt it didn't add that much to the already roller coaster-style dynamics of the song. These dynamics led Corgan to call \"Geek U.S.A.\" \"Gish all in one song\", while Butch Vig, the producer of Siamese Dream, called it \"one of the most amazing drum performances [he] had ever heard\"\n\nAlthough it was never released as a single, it was featured on the Triple J compilation album Eleven. \"Geek U.S.A.\" was reworked from an earlier song by the band entitled \"Suicide Kiss\". A live version of \"Geek U.S.A.\" appears on the album Earphoria and companion video Vieuphoria.\n\nA live performance of the song also appears on the band's official Greatest Hits Video Collection. This concert footage, filmed for a Seattle television special, was the band's first experience with directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who shot several more videos for the band in subsequent years. The concert was notable for the presence of 50 professional clowns on-stage with the Pumpkins, after the band was told they would be presented however they wished on tour. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin and director Jonathan Dayton (who was also dressed as a clown to be able to film close-ups of the band) agreed that the performance turned very dangerous when the clowns began performing stage dives.\n\n\"Geek U.S.A.\" was performed by the band from 1992 to 1996, with a brief re-appearance in the repertoire in 1999. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smashing+Pumpkins/_/Geek+U.S.A.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
