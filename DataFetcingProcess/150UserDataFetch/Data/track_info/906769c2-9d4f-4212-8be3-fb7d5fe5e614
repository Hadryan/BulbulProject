It was in their set when Zeppelin reunited for a one-off concert at the O2 Arena in London on December 10, 2007. John Bonham's son Jason filled in on drums at that show.\n\nWhat John Bonham played as percussion to supplement his drums on this song is not clear. It sounds like bongos, but has been reported to be a plastic garbage pail or a guitar case.\n\nSource: Song Facts <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Ramble+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
