Following on the heels of the number-one UK hit, \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\", \"Time (Clock of the Heart)\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. In the U.S., the song matched the number-two peak of its predecessor on the Billboard Hot 100.The song sold up 600,000 copies in UK alone gold award,and up 2 milion copies worldwide.\n\nIn Europe and United Kingdom, it was a stand-alone single, released in November 1982. For this market, its first inclusion on a Culture Club album was on their 1987 compilation, called This Time: The First Four Years.\n\nLike many of the songs composed by Boy George at this time, the lyrics interrogate the pleasure and shame inherent in taboo homosexual relationships. The song can be interpreted as both a seduction piece, and a lament, for Jon Moss, the band's drummer, with whom George was romantically involved.\n\nIn a retrospective review of the song, Allmusic journalist Stewart Mason wrote: \"Of all of Culture Club's early hits, Time (Clock of the Heart) has probably aged the best. Boy George drops the cryptic self-mythology long enough to deliver a tender, heartfelt lyric on lost love.\"[1]\n\nThe music video has been released in two versions. The only difference was a scene where the group is watching TV, along with vocalist Helen Terry. In one version, a Christmas tree is shown. In the other, the tree is removed. This was because of the date of release for certain markets. The \"Christmas\" version (which is on the 2005 DVD \"Greatest Hits\"), was for European countries and the \"regular version\" was for the other markets, where the song was released in spring 1983.\n\nThe song has been remixed in 1998 for a Japanese compilation. It was also released as a \"reggae dub\" version on Culture Club's 2002 Box Set. A rare promo 12\" was also issued in 1999 in United Kingdom, including three dance remixes by Quivver, which was released in the same time as Culture Club's single \"Your Kisses Are Charity\". One remix (Amityville Mix) was also included on the limited CD of that single.\n\nIn 2008, for his solo shows, Boy George let his former backing singer, Zee Asha, sing this song as a special guest <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Culture+Club/_/Time+(Clock+Of+The+Heart)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
