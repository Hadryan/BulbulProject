This hard hitting track has all the makings of a get up and dance mix that every festival needs so it is no wonder the beat was the #1 played song at Tomorrowland and Ultra Croatia while also being featured in Billboard/Rolling Stone Magazine. The song starts off with just a simple beat pattern, like any storm would, very calm before the crashing melodies of thunder drums and intense flashing of electric lightening. And finally, the water comes in the form of strong pounding beats and loud rushing waves of everything new school hard house.\n\nOne this is for certain, this is one tsunami I would not mind being in the middle of, dance on you crazy storm you. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DVBBS/_/Tsunami\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
