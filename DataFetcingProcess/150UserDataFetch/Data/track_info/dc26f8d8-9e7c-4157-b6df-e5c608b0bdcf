From lisbonmaru.com:\n\nOn October 1st 1942, the American submarine Grouper fired six torpedoes at a Japanese troop transport, the Lisbon Maru, off Shanghai. Five of the unreliable Mk 14 fish either passed under the target or failed to detonate, but one exploded against the stern, bringing the ship to a standstill. Grouper immediately came under attack from patrol boats and aircraft, and departed the scene, taking one last look at 700 Japanese soldiers being taken off the stricken vessel.\n\n What they didn't see, however, was that the soldiers had battened down the hatches over the holds as they left. In those holds, trapped and waiting to drown in appalling conditions of filth, disease, and malnutrition were over 1,800 British Prisoners of War who had been captured at the fall of Hong Kong nine months earlier.\n\nNone need have died, but only 748 returned to Britain alive. This is the story of the ship, the submarine, and the men. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fuck+Buttons/_/The+Lisbon+Maru\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
