However, the references to Guns N' Roses that were made in the film (from John Connor's friend's Guns N' Roses t-shirt to the T-800 taking out his shotgun from a box of roses, thus playing a pun on the band's name) were so clear and obvious that it was a wise business decision to make when director James Cameron decided to recruit the band to perform a song. As it would turn out, \"You Could Be Mine\" was selected to be included in the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger had the band members over for dinner at his own home to negotiate the deal. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses/_/You+Could+Be+Mine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
