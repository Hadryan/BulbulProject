This song fades in slowly, beginning in last few moments of disposition. As with all the songs in this part of the CD, they are very cyclical in terms of dynamics; it builds, climaxes, and fades, only to repeat itself again. The length gives it plenty of time to lurk in the beginning, slowly progressing and changing until the vocals finally arrive, sounding more like an instrument at times than actual vocals. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/Reflection\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"This is probably the most psychedelic of the beautiful Lateralus ending suite (lateralus through triad).

The length gives it plenty of time to lurk in the beginning, slowly progressing and changing until the vocals finally arrive, sounding more like an instrument at times than actual vocals. The lyrics eastern and philosophical, but are probably just a reflection of a personally meaningful psychedelic experience. A good pair of headphones or monitors is a must. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/Reflection\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
