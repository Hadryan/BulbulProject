It is the final track on Bob Marley & the Wailers' ninth album, Uprising, produced by Chris Blackwell and released by Island Records. The song is considered one of Marley's seminal works, with some key lyrics derived from a speech given by the Pan-Africanist orator Marcus Garvey.\n\nAt the time he wrote the song, circa 1979, Bob Marley had been diagnosed with the cancer that later was to take his life. According to Rita Marley, \"he was already secretly in a lot of pain and dealt with his own mortality, a feature that is clearly apparent in the album, particularly in this song\".\n\nUnlike most of Bob Marley's tracks, it is strictly a solo acoustic recording, consisting of Marley singing and playing an acoustic guitar, without accompaniment. In subsequent live performances, however, a full band was used. A full band rendition of \"Redemption Song\" was made available as a bonus track on the 2001 reissue of Uprising, as well as featuring on the 2001 compilation One Love: The Very Best of Bob Marley & the Wailers. However, the solo performance remains the take most familiar to listeners.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone placed the song at #66 among The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2010, the New Statesman listed it as one of the Top 20 Political Songs.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nBob Marley – vocals, acoustic guitar, production\n\n    With Bob accompanying himself on Guitar, \"Redemption Song\" was unlike anything he had ever recorded: an acoustic ballad, without any hint of reggae rhythm. In message and sound it recalled Bob Dylan. Biographer Timothy White called it an 'acoustic spiritual' and another biographer, Stephen Davis, pointed out the song was a 'total departure', a deeply personal verse sung to the bright-sounding acoustic strumming of Bob's Ovation Adamis guitar.\n    — James Henke, author of Marley Legend\n\n\nMeaning and social impact\n\nThe song urges listeners to \"Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,\" because \"None but ourselves can free our minds\". These lines were taken from a speech given by Marcus Garvey in Nova Scotia during October 1937 and published in his Black Man magazine:\n\n    We are going to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery because whilst others might free the body, none but ourselves can free the mind. Mind is your only ruler, sovereign. The man who is not able to develop and use his mind is bound to be the slave of the other man who uses his mind ...\n\nIn 2009, Jamaican poet and broadcaster Mutabaruka chose \"Redemption Song\" as the most influential recording in Jamaican music history.\n\n\nCovers\n\n    * Michael McDonald made this song his own on his 2008 album \"Soul Speak\".\n    * Manfred Mann's Earth Band covered the song on their 1983 album Somewhere in Afrika.\n    * Jackson Browne performed an acoustic version at the 1995 opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that was released on the all-star album Concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n    * English R&B girl group Eternal covered the song on their 1995 album Power of a Woman.\n    * Life Of Agony included an acoustic version on limited editions of their 1995 album Ugly.\n    * Punk rock band No Use For A Name recorded a cover for their 1995 album Leche Con Carne.\n    * A rare cover recorded by Stevie Wonder was included on his 1996 compilation Stevie Wonder - Song Review: Greatest Hits.\n    * US-based duo Moodswings included a cover of the song on their 1997 release Psychedelicatessen.\n    * Sinéad O'Connor performed this song live during her 1997 tour.

Prophetically, it also contains some of the band’s finest crafted material, as if they were cogent that this would be their final outing. The album’s blend of religious and secular themes likewise creates a very powerful and singular quest for spirituality in a material world.\n\nAlbum Tracks:\n\n01 Coming In From The Cold\n02 Real Situation\n03 Bad Card\n04 We And Dem\n05 Work\n06 Zion Train\n07 Pimper’s Paradise\n08 Could You Be Loved\n09 Forever Loving Jah\n10 Redemption Song\n11 Redemption Song (Band Version)\n12 Could You Be Loved (12” Mix) \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&+The+Wailers/_/Redemption+Song\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
