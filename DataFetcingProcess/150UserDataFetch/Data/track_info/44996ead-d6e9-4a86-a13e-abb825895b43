It charted at #7 in the UK Singles Chart, making it Mika's fourth straight top 10 single. Lyrically, the song is about ending a relationship tragically, and being alone.\n\nAbout the song's meaning, Mika said \"It's about a few things. In a way, it's a kind of sad break-up song like 'My Interpretation.' But, at the same time, it's about a lot of other things. I'll never forget when I was actually recording this song in Los Angeles, I would take this drive from where I was staying to the studio, which wasn't in the city and the amount of homeless people I saw on the way was absolutely shocking. Those horrible images of homelessness that I would see every morning really connected with that song. So it just comes to show you that a bright song in a certain mindset had a meaning that really evolves and changes as time goes by. I think that it is very important that other listeners find their own meaning to songs.\"\n\nThe woman singing with Mika in “Happy Ending” on the album is Ida Falk Winland, an opera singer and former classmate of Mika's from the Royal College of Music.  Mika has had a few different singers accompany him on \"Happy Ending\" for his live performances including Saranayde (Sara Skeete), Erika Footman, and Ms. Winland herself.\n\nAccording to en.wikipedia.org : Taken from his debut album Life in Cartoon Motion, producer Greg Wells remixed and rearranged the single, released online on 8 October 2007, and in shops on CD and 7\" vinyl on 15 October 2007.\n\nThe music video starts with a piano playing on its own, then the camera shows Mika on the bed. He is singing and has a pink balloon attached on his arm and while he is floating above, it reveals Mika with a pink suit. His room walls are shown full of pictures that start moving their mouths and singing with Mika. Mika passes through white balloons, which show all the times he felt different emotions. The video ends with Mika singing, and gloved hands resembling singing faces. He smiles as the screen goes black. The music video was directed by AlexandLiane. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mika/_/Happy+Ending\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
