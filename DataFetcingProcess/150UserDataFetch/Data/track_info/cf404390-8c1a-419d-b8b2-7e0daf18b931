The track was also covered by British rock band Placebo as a B-side to their 2000 single Taste in Men and on their 2003 album Covers.\n\nAnthony Monn covered the song as Johnny und Mary in German in the early 80s.\n\nZÃ¼ri West have translated the song into a Swiss dialect for their 2008 release Haubi Songs. This translation seems to be independent of the translation for Anthony Monn's cover.\n\n\"Johnny and Mary\" was used as the signature tune in advertisements promoting Renault cars throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Early adverts used Palmer's original version, while a range of special recordings in different styles were produced during the 1990s; most famously Martin Taylor's acoustic interpretation which he released on his album Spirit of Django. Taylor recorded alternate versions for Renault; the last being in 1998 for the launch of the all-new Renault Clio.\n\nAll Music Guide notes that \"Johnny and Mary\" had to be the inspiration for Rod Stewart's later hit Young Turks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Palmer/_/Johnny+and+Mary\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
