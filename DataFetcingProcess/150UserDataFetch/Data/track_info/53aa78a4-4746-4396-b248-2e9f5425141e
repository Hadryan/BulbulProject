He also notes that he will no longer use the accent in the future right after saying how his last album, Relapse, wasn't as good compared to his previous albums. He promises he will never leave again and now only has his daughters and his music to focus on.\"\n\nThe song was featured on 24/7, showcasing the preparations of the Floyd Mayweather vs. Shane Mosley fight. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/_/Not+Afraid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
