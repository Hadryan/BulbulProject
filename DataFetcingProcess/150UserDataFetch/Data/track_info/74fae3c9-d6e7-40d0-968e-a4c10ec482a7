(In the film Don't Look Back, a documentary of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, Baez is shown in one scene singing a fragment of the song in a hotel room late at night. She then tells Dylan, \"If you finish it, I'll sing it on a record.\") Baez first included the song on Any Day Now, her 1968 album of Dylan covers; she has since recorded it three additional times. Her 1968 recording was also released as a single.\n\nDylan himself appears to have never recorded the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Baez/_/Love+Is+Just+a+Four-Letter+Word\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
