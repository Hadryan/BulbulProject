The deep breaths in the chorus were rumoured to have symbolised taking a long inhalation (toke) of a marijuana joint.\n\nAccording to McCartney, he wrote the lines \"Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure\" and \"That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure.\", but in a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon claimed those lyrics were a dig at the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn an interview for Rolling Stone magazine on 5 December 1980, Lennon said his 1980 song \"[Woman] reminds me of a Beatles track, but I wasn't trying to make it sound like that. I did it as I did 'Girl' many years ago. So this is the grown-up version of 'Girl.'\" (\"Woman\" was the second single released from the Double Fantasy album, and the first Lennon single issued after his death on 8 December 1980.)\n\nIn November 1977, Capitol Records scheduled the United States release of \"Girl\" backed with \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\" as a single (Capitol 4506) to accompany the release of Love Songs, a Beatles' compilation album that contains both of these songs. However, the single was cancelled before it was issued. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
