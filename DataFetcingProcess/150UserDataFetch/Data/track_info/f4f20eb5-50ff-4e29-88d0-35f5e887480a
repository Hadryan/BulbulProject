Because of the ferocity of the song and the general opinion of the song (see next paragraph), the word \"ether\" is commonly used within the hip-hop community as a term for a devastating diss. \"Ethered\" is also used as a verb to describe a rap artist that took a significant loss (e.g. He got ethered).\n\nAfter this track was released, many rap artists agreed that Nas won the feud. This, however, is a matter of opinion and debatable. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nas/_/Ether\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
