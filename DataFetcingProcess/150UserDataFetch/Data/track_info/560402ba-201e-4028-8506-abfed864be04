Recorded March 2, 1959 at Columbia \nStudios, New York City.  Soloists are (in order): Davis, Coltrane, Adderley, Evans (with horns), \nChambers (final melody).  Written by Miles Davis.\n\nThis song is one of the first and most famous instances of modal jazz, where the harmony is based on a scale rather than a rapidly changing series of chords.  So What's bass line and melody are based on the D dorian scale, and the only changes are in the \"B\" section of the song, moving up a half step, \nbefore returning back down. The solos follow this same progression, using D dorian for the first \n16 bars,  Eb dorian for the next 8 bars, and D dorian again for the last 8.\n\nThe lesser known \"So What\" is from the 1951 album \"Conception\", a standard that was also performed by Chubby Jackson featuring Gerry Mulligan in 1950, immediately after Miles' \"Birth of Cool\" sessions. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/_/So+What\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
