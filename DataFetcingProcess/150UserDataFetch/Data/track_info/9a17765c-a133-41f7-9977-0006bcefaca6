Prince wrote seven of the eight songs on the album, but Nothing Compares 2 U is the only track for which Prince takes official credit.\n\nAfter becoming a worldwide number one single when covered by Irish singer Sinead O'Connor , Prince began playing the song live, and in 1993, he released a live version (sharing lead vocals with Rosie Gaines) as the eleventh track (one of two new tracks) on The Hits 1.\n\nHe has played it live consistently since 1990, and in 2002, released another live version as the twelfth track on the second disc of his first live album, One Nite Alone... Live! (along with Xenophobia, Extraordinary, Avalanche, Family Name, Raspberry Beret, The Everlasting Now,  I Wanna B Ur Lover, Diamonds & Pearls, The Beautiful Ones and How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore from the same show).\n\nPrince's own studio version remains unreleased, however.\n\nInitial tracking for Prince's original version took place on 18 July, 1984 at the Flying Cloud Drive Warehouse, Eden Prairie (the same day Let's Go Crazy was released as a single). St. Paul Peterson and Susannah Melvoin overdubbed vocals onto the track in late 1984 -early 1985, and Clare Fischer added orchestral overdubs during the same period.\n\nPrince was inspired to write the song about Sandy Scipioni, his personal assistant in 1980, who had to leave suddenly after her father's death (Prince and Scipioni were not in a romantic relationship, however). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Nothing+Compares+2+U\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
