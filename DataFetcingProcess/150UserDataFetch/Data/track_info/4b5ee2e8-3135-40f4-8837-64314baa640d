Many musical acts have recorded cover versions of the song, and the song is frequently used and referenced during sporting events and in television shows and films.\n\nThe title of the song was conceived by Ozzy Osbourne. Geezer Butler took to writing the lyrics around the title, but was careful not to make it about the comic book character so as to avoid a copyright infringement lawsuit. Thus making the song telling the story of a vengeful villain instead of a superhero. Nonetheless, instrumental sections of the song were used in the 2008 feature film Iron Man at the beginning of the credits, and in the television commercials. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/_/Iron+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
