The song was played live from its debut in 1993 up until 1996 when it was dropped. The song made a return appearance at the band's April 11, 2003 show in West Palm Beach, Florida at the Sound Advice Amphitheatre. The song has since returned to Pearl Jam set lists. A live performance of the song appears on the \"Dissident\"/Live in Atlanta box set.\n\nEddie tells Jones about 'Glorified G': \n\n' I didn't actually write that song,' he told me. \n'I was at a band rehearsal and just started writing down these things the guys were talking about. The band were having this conversation and I just took down the dialogue. One of the band members had just bought a gun. It was the drummer, actually. Ask him about it.' \n\nI did, and this is what he had to say: \n'I told our manager that I just bought a coupla guns and he told Jeff, and at rehearsal Jeff kinda blurted it out. \nAnd Eddie went, 'Whaaaat, you bought a GUN?' And I said, 'In fact, I bought two,' which ended up as the opening line of the song. \n\n'I think it's fair to say Eddie was pretty outraged. \nBut like I told him, where I come from in Texas people have a very different \nattitude towards guns than they do in California, where he's from. \nSame with Jeff. He's from Montana. And that's where you have a gun on the back of the pick-up truck with a bullet in it, ready to go. Like Jeff's dad \nsays, 'The best way to be safe with a gun is to allways keep it loaded.' \n\n'In Texas, people have guns to defend their land. Hell, I've had guns in my stomach a buncha times. But in California, because there's so much violence with guns and there are all these gangs, it's a completely different trip. I giggle my ass off when we play it live.' \n\n'That's because you're a country freak asshole.' said Stone. \n'That song is a borderline nutso,' said Mike McCready. 'That song is a borderline not working at all,' said Stone. 'It's very Eddie. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/_/Glorified+G\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
