She insists on continuing the pursuit of this character until he does love her. \n\nAccording to the Paparazzi Songfacts, Lady GaGa told About.com: \"The song is about a few different things – it's about my struggles, do I want fame or do I want love? It's also about wooing the paparazzi to fall in love with me. It's about the media whoring, if you will, watching ersatzes make fools of themselves to their station. It's a love song for the cameras, but it's also a love song about fame or love – can you have both, or can you only have one?\" \n\nLady GaGa has performed many different versions of Paparazzi. The most eye catching was her VMA 2009 performance, where she bled and later hung from the ceiling. In an interview, GaGa said her performance was about Princess Diana and how the paparazzi killed her. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Paparazzi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
