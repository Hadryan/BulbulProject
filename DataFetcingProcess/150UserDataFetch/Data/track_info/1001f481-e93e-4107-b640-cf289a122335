Originally released on a double A-side single (along with \"Staying Fat\" in May 2004 by Moshi Moshi Records, it was re-released as a regular single in the United Kingdom by Wichita Recordings on 25 April 2005. It was their first single to chart on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks where it came in at number 34, and is often credited as their breakthrough single in North America. The song is written in B-flat minor, an unconventional key signature for songs of such a genre. It was also featured in the song \"Bloc Party\" on the Fort Minor Mixtape: We Major. It was #31 in NME's top 100 tracks of the decade, and was number 54 in Triple J's Hottest 100 of all time. It peaked at #13 on the UK singles chart. In 2011, NME placed it at number 20 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\n\n\nMusic videos\n\nThere were two videos for \"Banquet\". A non-released version contains a recurring theme of hands with the hands pushing around band members Russell Lissack and Gordon Moakes while other hands cover up drummer Matt Tong's head and cast a shadow over frontman Kele Okereke. The hands eventually try to stab all of Bloc Party, set fire to the set and destroy the instruments and amps. Meanwhile, the released version shows the group performing in front of many different people. It is shown in full color and in black and white. The music video has gained around 14 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n\nReleased: 25 April 2005\nFormat: CD, 7\"\nRecorded: 2004\nGenre: Post-punk revival\nLength: 3.21\nLabel: Wichita\nProducer(s): Paul Epworth <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/_/Banquet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
