And I just hated it. I had a lot of fun, but I had a lot of fun hating it.\"\n\nOn the Howard Stern show, December 9, 1999, Courtney Love said the song was written about her.\n\nThe B-sides came from the 2 Meter Sessions. They were performed live in the Netherlands on November 22, 1999.\n\nOn September 3, 1999, the Foo Fighters played a secret gig at the Troubador in Los Angeles playing using the pseudo band name Stacked Actors. The gig was intended as a warm up for the bands newly recruited guitarist Chris Shiflett. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Stacked+Actors\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
