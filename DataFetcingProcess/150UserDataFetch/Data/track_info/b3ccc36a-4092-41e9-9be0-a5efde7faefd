Noel Gallagher provides lead vocals on both tracks, which he also wrote.\n\n\"Little by Little\" was perhaps the most controversial song on the album, receiving mixed reviews from those who felt it was a classic example of an upbeat Oasis anthem and those who felt it was a twee, patronising, sycophantic melody. Regardless of this, the song managed to peak at number two in the UK charts based largely on the publicity garnered by the song.\n\nThe promo video to the song featured a guest role by Robert Carlyle. The cover art for the single is an homage to Robert Indiana's LOVE artwork. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Little+by+Little\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
