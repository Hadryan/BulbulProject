For example, in its otherwise positive review of the album, Sputnikmusic wrote: :“Being Held” is perhaps most guilty in this respect. This track, exceeding five minutes, starts off with a droning bell-like sound eventually accompanied by a soft drum beat and culminates in a heavier drum beat. The track has no vocals, and is evidently the worst song on the LP. In opposition to an inclination for a solid climax, many will find that the haunting atmosphere and musicianship are more than enough to satisfy.\"\n\nWhile Pitchfork, which gave the record 8/10, wrote: \"'Being Held' is the undeniable apotheosis of the album; it consists of little more than an insistent bell-like drone, subsonic bass feedback, and a neck-snapping drum solo. That's all the For Carnation needs to keep you in white- knuckled suspense for 5\\xBD minutes.\"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+For+Carnation/_/Being+Held\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
