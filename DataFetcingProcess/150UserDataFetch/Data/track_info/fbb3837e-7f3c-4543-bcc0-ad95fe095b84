Due to its status as a Bond theme it was also covered by The Pretenders (released exclusively on the album Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project), and Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas performed the song on Movies Rocks 2007, a CBS special celebrating music in movies. British pop singer Geri Halliwell, of the Spice Girls, released the song as a b-side track for her solo number one single Lift Me Up, in November 1999. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses/_/Live+and+Let+Die\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
