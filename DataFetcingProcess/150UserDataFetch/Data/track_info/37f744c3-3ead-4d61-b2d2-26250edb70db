Sung by McVie and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, it was the third single from the band's 1977 hit album Rumours, and is one of the band's most enduring hits, peaking at number three on the Billboard singles chart.\n\n\"Don't Stop\" reflects Christine's feelings after her separation from Fleetwood Mac's bass guitarist John McVie after eight years of marriage. \"'Don't Stop' was just a feeling. It just seemed to be a pleasant revelation to have that 'yesterday's gone,'\" Christine remembers in The Fleetwood Mac Story: Rumours and Lies, \"It might have, I guess, been directed more toward John, but I'm just definitely not a pessimist.\"\n\nIt was used by U.S. presidential candidate Bill Clinton as the theme for his first campaign, most notably at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. Upon winning the election, President Clinton persuaded the then-disbanded group to reform to perform it for his inaugural ball in 1993. At the 2000 convention, he ended his speech by saying, \"Keep putting people first. Keep building those bridges. And don't stop thinking about tomorrow!\" Immediately after this sentence, the song began playing over the loudspeakers.\n\nA live performance of the song was used as a music video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Don%27t+Stop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
