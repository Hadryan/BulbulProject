Songwriter John Fogerty intended the song as a protest against the Vietnam War. The song is critical of the fortunate sons of those in high places e.g. the political elite and/or the wealthy who are able to avoid the horrors of war for themselves or their relatives by benefiting from their privileged backgrounds.\n\nFogerty says that the song was indirectly inspired by David Eisenhower, the grandson of President Dwight David Eisenhower who married Julie Nixon, the daughter of President Richard Nixon in 1968. Eisenhower did later enlist in the Navy Reserve and served three years on active duty in the early 70s as an officer aboard a US Navy cruiser in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nFogerty himself was drafted and served six months in various military bases in the United States. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival/_/Fortunate+Son\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
