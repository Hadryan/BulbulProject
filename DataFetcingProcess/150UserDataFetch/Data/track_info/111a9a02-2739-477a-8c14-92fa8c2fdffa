The lead vocal was sung by Mike Love on the final release but some sessions have been released with Brian singing lead. Some studio chatter could be heard during the instrumental break (only in mono version release) and the subject matter was revealed to be about cameras in the 40th anniversary CD booklet. It was later released as the B-side to the 1967 single \"Darlin'\". Recently the song was re-recorded by Brian Wilson and his band in his 2002 live album Pet Sounds Live. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Here+Today\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
