The song repeats the word trouble throughout the lyrics, and its musicscape is minimalist.\n\nThe song was released on 26 October 2000 as the album's third single. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's second Top 10 single in the country. Although Trouble failed to chart on the main singles chart in the United States, the music press deemed it almost as successful as its predecessor, Yellow . Two different music videos for the song were released.\n\nAccording to Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin, he wrote Trouble as a result of his own behavior. He recalls, \"There were some bad things going in our band ... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band.\" He added that he supposed it was about time to act of a knobhead. The four members of Coldplay co-wrote \"trouble \".\n\nLike the song \"Yellow\", which repeats the word yellow, Martin wrote \"Trouble\" with the repetitive use of the word trouble. The song's lyrics are on \"softer emotional themes\"; including apologies, unrequited love, and longing. The song's musicscape was said to be minimalist. Trouble is built around a piano, with a snare drum background that was mixed very low. The snare drum section tends to be inaudible when the guitars come in. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Trouble\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
