The track introduced Sheila E. to the public and is regarded as a funk classic. It is one of many Prince tracks that is generally recognised by the first note (a guitar string plucked and whammied) before dropping into the drum track.\n\nThe experimental number relies on a strong bass line and a simple but enticing keyboard riff. The song features Prince's voice both sped up and slowed down at various times to sound like different singers. Also featured is Sheila E., who would become a close associate with Prince and work with him extensively over the years. Even though the song was a B-side to a #1 hit, it received significant radio play itself and is almost as well-known as the songs on Purple Rain. The song was quite notable for its extreme sexual references and the use of the word \"fuck\", although people have claimed the word was actually \"funk\", allowing it to be played on the radio. It has been heard in the films Girl 6 and PCU (covered by George Clinton). The track was re-released on CD on The Hits/The B-Sides in 1993 and later on the Girl 6 soundtrack. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Erotic+City\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
