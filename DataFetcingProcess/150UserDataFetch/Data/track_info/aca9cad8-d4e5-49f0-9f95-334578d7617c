The song is notable for marking the beginning of producer Stephen Street's working relationship with the band. As one of his first roles as \"in-house engineer\" at Island Records' Fallout Shelter studios, Street engineered the session. He was well aware of the band and excited by the prospect, saying in a HitQuarters interview, \"I’d seen them just shortly beforehand on Top Of The Pops doing ‘This Charming Man’, and like most other people around that time who were into music I was really excited by them.\" Street says his enthusiasm must have rubbed off on Morrissey and Johnny Marr because they would take his name and number. Although not contacted for the subsequent recording \"William, It Was Really Nothing\", he was asked to engineer their next album, Meat Is Murder, with Morrissey and Marr producing for the first time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Heaven+Knows+I%27m+Miserable+Now\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
