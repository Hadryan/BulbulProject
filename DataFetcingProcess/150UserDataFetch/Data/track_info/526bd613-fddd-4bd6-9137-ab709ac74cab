Eric Clapton, who was a good friend of George's, played lead guitar on the album version of the song with a Gibson Les Paul guitar. On The Concert for Bangladesh, he performed it on a Gibson Super 400 hollowbody guitar, and later acknowledged that a solid-body guitar would have been more appropriate.\nAccording to Harrison, inspiration for the song came from reading the I Ching, which, as he put it, \"seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.\"\nTaking this idea of relativism to his parents' home in the North of England, Harrison committed to write a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a random book. Those first words were \"gently weeps\", and he immediately began the song.\nThe song was ranked #135 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\nThe song was also ranked #7 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 100 greatest guitar songs of all time.\n\nGeorge Harrison – double-tracked vocal, backing vocal, guitar, Hammond organ \nJohn Lennon – guitar \nPaul McCartney – backing vocal, piano, organ, 6-string bass \nRingo Starr – drums, tambourine \nEric Clapton – lead guitar \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/While+My+Guitar+Gently+Weeps\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
