It was released in April 1993 as the lead single from the album Serenity. The song achieved huge success worldwide, reaching number-one in Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It also spent ten weeks at number-one on the RPM Dance chart in Canada.\nWritten by Steven Levis, Nosie Katzmann and Jay Supreme and produced by Torsten Fenslau and Peter Zweier, Mr. Vain was 1993's best-selling single across Europe. Typical of the Eurodance style of the time, the song first broke in Germany before breaking more widely through the summer, eventually topping the chart in twelve countries. It reached number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned a Gold disc. \"Mr. Vain\" also peaked at number two for two weeks on the American Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. Tania Evans is the female singer in Mr. Vain, and the rapper is Jay Supreme.\n\nIt first entered the charts in the United Kingdom in late July 1993 at number 24 climbing to number one for the week ending 28 August 1993, at times it was selling twice as much its nearest challenger It Keeps Rainin' by Bitty McLean during its 4 week reign at the top. It spent a total of 15 weeks on the chart and was the 9th biggest selling single in Britain in 1993.\n\nIt is notable in the United Kingdom as it was the first number one single not to be available as a 7\" since the 1950s and heralded the demise of the 7\" single as a mass market medium. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Culture+Beat/_/Mr.+Vain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
