She thereby ruins the relationship due to her paranoia\nThe word 'Babushka' itself means 'grandmother' in Russian, something Bush \"didn't realise at the time\". In context of the song however, Bush just \"popped the name out, because it felt right\", and that she apparently picked the name out of a fairy story when she was younger, before discovering its Russian meaning, and how 'Babushka' was a good name for the woman in the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/_/Babooshka\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
