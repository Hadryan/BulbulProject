In addition, it made it to # 49 on the Canadian Hot 100 because of digital sales.\n\nBackground\n\nPerry has revealed that she was inspired to write the track after running naked through a park. According to Music Rooms, Perry claims that after a wild night of partying and streaking, she wrote the song about her antics the next day. Perry revealed: “There’s nothing better than an impromptu dance party with my friends. My track Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) is a song about debauchery because I had one of those nights in Santa Barbara. We went out to this place called Wildcat and got crazy,” Perry admitted: “We had a couple of beers and danced until we died, then brought the party back to the hotel room.” She added: “Most of that song is actual truth, apart from the ménage à trois… unfortunately! But, yes, streaking in the park, that’s what we did, so we had to write a song about it the next day!” Bonnie McKee, the co-writer of the song stated \"TGIF is pretty much a word for word description of our trip to Santa Barbara [with Perry], so I love that one. It’s really kitschy and fun and makes me nostalgic.\"\n\n\n\nReleased: June 6, 2011 (2011-06-06)\nRecorded: \tConway Recording Studios,\n(Hollywood, California);\nPlayback Recording Studios,\n(Santa Barbara, California)\nGenre: \tPop Rock\nLength:\t3:50\nLabel:\tCapitol\nWriter(s): \tKaty Perry, Lukasz Gottwald, Max Martin, Bonnie McKee\nProducer: \tDr. Luke, Max Martin <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Last+Friday+Night+(T.G.I.F.)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
