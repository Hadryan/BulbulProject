In 2009 it was named the 27th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\nThe song was written by lead singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes, and proved to be one of the band's most popular songs. It combines the blues origins of the band with the more distorted, harder sound driving the song, making for a powerful hard rock song. The current Whitesnake lineup and John Sykes both play the song as their live encore.\n\nThe song has been cited as sounding similar to Led Zeppelin's \"Black Dog\", a possible source of inspiration for Coverdale and Sykes.\n\nA music video, featuring Coverdale's then future wife Tawny Kitaen, was shot for the song, and it was MTV's most requested video in its first week of release.\n\nA cover version of the song is featured in the video game Rock Revolution. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Whitesnake/_/Still+of+the+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
