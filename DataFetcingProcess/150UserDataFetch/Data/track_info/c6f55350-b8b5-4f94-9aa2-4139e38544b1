The remaining lyrics explain in a general way the premise of the film: a mystery tour of the type that was popular in Britain when the Beatles were young. Lennon and McCartney expanded the tour to make it magical, which allowed it to be \"a little more surreal than the real ones.\"\nRecording began on 25 April 1967, less than a week after the final sessions for Sgt.

The Beatles added bass guitar and vocal overdubs on 26 and 27 April.
