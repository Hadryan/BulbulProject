The song was completed two days later with additional guitar and percussion.\n\nThis song was performed directly after \"Polythene Pam\", the song on the preceding track, without pause. John Lennon and Ringo Starr assume their usually respective roles on the acoustic rhythm guitar and the drums. Allegedly, McCartney plays lead guitar on this song, while George Harrison plays the bass part.\n\nAt the very beginning of the song, John Lennon says, \"We'll listen to that now...Oh, look out!\" Lennon then says, \"You should\".\n\nA slower, ethereal version of this song, recorded during the Let It Be sessions, can be heard on Anthology 3. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/She+Came+in+Through+the+Bathroom+Window\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
