The song has become a fixture of Bowie’s live shows, and one of his best known album cuts.\n\nIn 1976, it was issued as a single to promote the ChangesOneBowie compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of “Stay” on the B-side. The single failed to chart. Suffragette City was also featured as a track in the 2006 Atari game Driver: Parallel Lines. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Suffragette+City\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
