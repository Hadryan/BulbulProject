You were the one to cut me, so I'll bleed forever.\", this necessarily being what this \"Ghost Love\" is about. \nThe reference to Advent of May, May the First, should be taken to refer to the completion of April/ Aprilis, the deity of Unveiling/ Apocalypsos/ Enlightenment and a major post-Apocalypse ceremony  in 71AD, involving the deity Pneuma (Ghost) on that day, when the Olympics were restored and inaugurated in true form (called a paraclasm) for the first time by Vespasian, Titus, et al. The long thrall of underworld deities under Caesars Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero, was overthrown in iconoclasm. The main underworld deities were Gaia (thought control, irrationality, single causes, and copying), Pluto-Mammon, the Furies-Medusae (love of hate and fear), Draco, the Devil (hedonistic bogus certainty dualisms), and Cyclops (one-sidedness), all straight from Socrates' Allegory of the Prisoners of the Cave.\nThe Main Olympic deities were Jove (Good Father), Juno (Mother role model), and Minerva (virgin sage career woman medic), whereas Pneuma (Ghost)  was more an earthbound spirit, just pure logic. Although Pliny Younger described the eventual outcome as \"Christians emptying the temples\", this was probably not the case because the Equestrian Mithras cult took off about this time, but was written out of history (as using a Not-Jesus military pseudoChrist, incarnated in one sword-wielding Sabinus), reportedly). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nightwish/_/Ghost+Love+Score\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
