It was the opening track on both his album and the film Purple Rain. \"Let's Go Crazy\" is one of Prince's most popular songs, and is almost always a staple for concert performances, often segueing into other hits. When released as a single, the song became Prince's second number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and also topped the two component charts, the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts, as well as becoming a UK Top 10 hit. The B-side was the lyrically controversial \"Erotic City\". In the UK, the song was released as a double A-side with \"Take Me with U\". \n\nThe song was also notable for opening with a funeral-like organ solo with Prince giving the \"eulogy\" for \"this thing called life.\" That eulogy ends with a distinctive drum machine pattern and then quickly becomes a full hard rock number with heavy guitar, bass and keyboards. The song's percussion was programmed with the venerable Linn LM-1 drum machine, an instrument frequently used in many of Prince's songs.\n\n\"Traffic Jam\", by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, is a style parody of \"Let's Go Crazy\", while two segments of Prince's unaccompanied guitar solo in the song's coda were sampled into Public Enemy's single \"Brothers Gonna Work It Out\". \n\nSong shows Prince's skills on guitar. Prince plays Hendrix-styled guitar licks and solos. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Let%27s+Go+Crazy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
