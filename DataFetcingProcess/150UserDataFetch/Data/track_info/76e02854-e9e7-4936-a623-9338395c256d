Mojo magazine named it the best song of all time in 2000.\n\nThe song was recorded on 18 October 1965, and was complete except for the instrumental bridge. At that time, Lennon had not decided what instrument to use, but he subsequently asked George Martin to play a piano solo, suggesting \"something Baroque-sounding\". Martin wrote a Bach-influenced piece that he found he could not play at the song's tempo. On 22 October, the solo was recorded at half-tempo (one octave lower) and tape speed was doubled for the final recording, solving the performance challenge and giving the piano solo a unique, harpsichord-like timbre. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/In+My+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
