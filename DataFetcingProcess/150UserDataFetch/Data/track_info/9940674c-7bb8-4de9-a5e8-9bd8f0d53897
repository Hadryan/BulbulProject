Some listeners have claimed that the song is about Lucifer seducing the listener; however, lyricist Geezer Butler clarifies that \"the song was about the devil falling in love and totally changing becoming a good person.\" (Quote from the 1992 documentary \"The Black Sabbath Story: Volume One.\")\n\n\"N.I.B.\" begins with a bass solo by Geezer Butler, titled \"Bassically\" on some US releases. It involves the use of wah-wah on his bass and was recorded in one take, as the amp's volume control is plainly turned up before the distorted bass intro of \"N.I.B.\" begins.\n\n\nMany bands have covered the song, including Cave In, Type O Negative, Radio Cult, Ugly Kid Joe, Acid Drinkers and Pitchshifter. Ozzy Osbourne and Primus recorded the song for Nativity in Black II. This version also appears in Osbourne's boxed set Prince of Darkness. The main riff is also played at the start of Strange Ways by Megadeth.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/_/N.I.B.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
