The \"New Real Book\" shows alternate bridge chords:\nDb9 | Db9 | D9 | D9 | Eb9 E9 | Eb9 D9 | Db9 C9 | B9 C7 |\n\nThese could be considered tritone substitution chords for the most part.\n\nAside from Monk's recordings, versions have been recorded by Miles Davis (on his album Steamin'), Herbie Hancock, and many others. Mike Ferro wrote lyrics for the song in the 1970s. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thelonious+Monk/_/Well,+You+Needn%27t\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
