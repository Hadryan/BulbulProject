Everett considers that McCartney's solo is in the same Dorian mode adapted by Harrison in Love You To. In 1987, Harrison stated: \"I was pleased to have Paul play that bit on 'Taxman'. If you notice, he did like a little Indian bit on it for me.\"Ian MacDonald praised McCartney's contributions to the song saying his guitar solo was \"outstanding\" and his bass part was \"remarkable\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Taxman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
