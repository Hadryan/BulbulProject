He plugged a wah-wah pedal and a Tubedriver into his 100-watt Marshall and he decided to use a Eventide 949s. The song was recorded  in about half an hour but the Eventide broke down and they couldn't recreate the original effect. They decided to leave the original version and make another one. It still went on to became his most famous song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Satriani/_/Surfing+with+the+Alien\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
