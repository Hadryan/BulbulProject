After performing several songs from her self titled debut during the afternoon, Chapman thought she'd done her bit and could relax and enjoy the rest of the concert. However, later in the evening Stevie Wonder was delayed when the computer discs for his performance went missing, and Chapman was ushered back onto stage again. In front of a huge prime time audience she performed \"Fast Car\" alone with her acoustic guitar. Afterwards the song raced up the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tracy+Chapman/_/Fast+Car\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
