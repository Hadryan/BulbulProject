That song came to him during a 5 minute coffee break. According to the Pour Some Sugar Songfacts, the idea for this song was taken from a line in the 1969 song \"Sugar, Sugar .\" Near the end of that song, there is a line that goes \"Pour a little sugar on me, baby.\" \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Def+Leppard/_/Pour+Some+Sugar+on+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
