Released in May 1982, it is considered the pinnacle of \"The Dark Trilogy\", three albums that gradually increase in anger and isolation as the albums go by. The Dark Trilogy consists of Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography.\n\nThe song starts off with a reversed sample of jumbled voices recorded off the television and radio one night. Smith has stated that the only distinguishable voice in the sample is Germaine Greer's. However, when played in reverse, the most clearly discernible voice is from a BBC Two continuity announcer:\n\n\"...at five past eight tomorrow.\n\nWell now there's the last look at the clock this evening. The time is just winding its way round to eight minutes to One.\nIf you're still up and about and want a bit more entertainment, a reminder that our colleagues over on BBC Radio are still on the airwaves on Radio Two. In eight minutes Sheila Tracey — that's Radio Two's Tiger Tim — takes over with \"The Truckers' Hour\". And then [at] Two O'Clock, \"You The Night And The Music\" with Tim Hutchins through 'til Five.\nBut for now, on behalf of everyone here on BBC Two, this is Robin Witting...\"\n\t\n\nA steady drum beat finally gives way to the anger of Smith's guitar and vocals, erupting with the final lines \"I must fight this sickness, find a cure\" finishing the album and the trilogy.\n\nThe song is the last song on which Laurence Tolhurst is credited with drumming on in the studio, and also the last song played before \"The Cure Is Dead\" at the infamous concert on 11 June 1982 in Belgium.\n\nThe song was also played on the 1983 mini tour (without the sample at the beginning) and occasionally on the tours for The Top, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me and even once on the tour for Wish. In 2000, the song started recurring in Cure setlists, and was most recently played on the Trilogy concerts.\n\n\nReleased \t1 May 1982\nRecorded \tRAK Studio One, London\nGenre \tGothic rock\nLength \t6:27\nLabel \tFiction\nProducer \tPhil Thornalley, The Cure <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Pornography\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
