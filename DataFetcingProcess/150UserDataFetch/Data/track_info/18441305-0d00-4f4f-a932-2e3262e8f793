In one interview he said: \"It's partly the idea of the businessman walking out on his wife and kids and never coming back. It's also the thousand yard stare when you look at someone close to you and you know they're gonna die. It's like a shadow over them, or the way they look straight through you. The shine goes out of their eyes.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Knives+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
