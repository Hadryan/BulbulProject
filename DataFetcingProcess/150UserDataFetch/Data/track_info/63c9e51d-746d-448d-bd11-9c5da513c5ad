While most apparently a love song, it can also be interpreted to be about Mother Nature, and how man abuses the Earth. This latter interpretation gains some credibility from the video, which seems to have been made with the issue very much in mind. Additionally, the album was named The Division Bell by Douglas Adams in exchange for the band contributing a sizeable donation to Save The Rhino International. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Take+It+Back\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Take It Back\" is a song from Pink Floyd's 1994 album, The Division Bell. While most apparently a love song, it can also be interpreted to be about Mother Nature, and how man abuses the Earth. This latter interpretation gains some credibility from the video, which seems to have been made with the issue very much in mind. Additionally, the album was named The Division Bell by Douglas Adams in exchange for the band contributing a sizeable donation to Save The Rhino International.\n\nThe opening riff bears some similarities to Marillion's \"The Release\" (a b-side from the \"Seasons End\" sessions). The band's lead singer Steve Hogarth hints on the band's official website: \"I always thought this song bears an uncanny resemblance to a certain Pink Floyd single... See you in court!...\"\n\nAround the middle of the song, starting at around 03:04, between the main lyrics, can be heard children chanting lines from a nursery rhyme \"Ring-O'-Roses\": \"...A pocket full of posies, atichoo, atichoo, we all fall down\". (A strong allusion to the same nursery rhyme can be heard in Marillion's song \"Forgotten Sons\", from the first album, \"Script for a Jester's Tear\" (1983): \"Ring-a-ring-o-roses, they all fall down...\".) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Take+It+Back\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
