The song was named the 79th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\nAccording to Billy Idol at a televised performance of VH1 Storytellers, the idea of a song thus entitled came to him at an event he once attended, where Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Ronnie Wood of The Rolling Stones were taking swigs of a \"Rebel Yell\" bottle of bourbon whiskey, a brand unknown to him, the name of which he liked; Billy decided and stated that he would set off to write a \"Rebel Yell\" song.\n\nThe song was co-written by guitarist Steve Stevens.
