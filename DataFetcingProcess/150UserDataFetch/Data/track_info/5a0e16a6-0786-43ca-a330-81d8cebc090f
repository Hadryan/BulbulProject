Live, the sound is produced by a bass-rich guitar tone, used in combination with a whammy pedal to create the heavily metallic sounding breaks of the song (\"How dare you, how old are you now anyway\" and \"get behind me, get behind me now anyway\".)\n\nThe single comes in three editions, each with different additional tracks. All three covers feature two people dressed up as The White Stripes, but are noticeably different people. The first CD and the 7\" feature the couple in the same order as Get Behind Me Satan, with 'Jack' on the right. The second CD version features 'Jack' on the left.\n\nIn an NPR interview, Jack White referred to \"Blue Orchid\" as the song that saved the album. He has denied that the song relates to the ending of his relationship with Ren√©e Zellweger.\n\nThe video for \"Blue Orchid\" was on Yahoo!'s Top Twenty Scariest Music Videos of all Time, charting at number 13. It features Karen Elson, a model who would marry Jack White soon after the shoot. The video, which was directed by Floria Sigismondi, ends with a horse, its hooves raised in the air, about to stomp on Elson, but just before the hooves land on her, the video quickly goes black, ending.\n\n\"Blue Orchid\" has been remixed by High Contrast on the album Fabric Live 25, and is the first track on disc 2 of the album. It features the main guitar riff accompanied by a much more Drum and Bass inspired backing drum beat. The vocals from the song, \"You took a white orchid, you took a white orchid and turned it blue\" repeated at various points throughout the track.\n\nThe song is used as the theme song for the Australian Radio Show Wil & Lehmo on Triple M\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Blue+Orchid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
