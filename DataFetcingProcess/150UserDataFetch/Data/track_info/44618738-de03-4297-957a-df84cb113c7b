It was produced by Stephen Hague, who also received a co-writing credit. \"Regret\" is generally regarded as one of the band's finest singles. In the United States, the song had two #1 terms on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and also topped the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, a very rare occurrence of a song being accepted on both rock and dance charts. It also peaked at a modest #28 on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming the band's biggest hit in the United States. The song made an impressive showing on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #4. The B-sides differed on the various releases in different formats and countries; all were remixes, including the Fire Island Mix and Junior Dub by Pete Heller and Terry Farley and various Sabres of Paradise mixes.\n\nA music video was also produced for the song, directed by Peter Care and it appears on the \"Regret\" promotional VHS, as well as A Collection. The video also appears in the PSP game Lumines II. The song was also covered by the American rock band The Get Up Kids and released on their compilation album Eudora in 2001.\n\nThe band filmed a memorable performance of the song for Top of the Pops from the beach where Baywatch was filmed, featuring David Hasselhoff and various extras in the background. The band initially wanted to have David mime along to the song too, but the producers of Baywatch wouldn't let them.\n\nThe song is one of very few which have topped both the US rock and Dance charts, the general differences between these genres being rarely bridged. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order/_/Regret\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
