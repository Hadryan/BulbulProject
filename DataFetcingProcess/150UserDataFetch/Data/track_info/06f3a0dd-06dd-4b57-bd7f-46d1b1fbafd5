Blige, produced by Dr. Dre. It was taken from her fifth album, No More Drama, and was responsible for popularizing the terms \"hateration\" and \"dancery\" in the US, as well as contributing to the popularity of the word \"crunk\".\n\nThe music for \"Family Affair\" was originally created in a jam session between Dr. Dre and musicians Mel-Man, Camara Kambon and Mike Elizondo. Later, Blige heard the song and she and her brother Bruce Miller contributed the lyrics and melody. Finally, Dr. Dre produced Blige's vocals, but this was done at a distance because at the time he was busy filming the movie Training Day. The music video was directed by Dave Meyers.\n\nThe single topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks from November 3, 2001. It was Blige's first Hot 100 number-one, although she had previously reached number two with \"Not Gon' Cry\" in 1996.\nIn 2007, this song was used on a Propel Fitness Water commercial. According to Rolling Stone's Magazine Dr.Dre earned 2 million dollars in royalties from the mega-hit.\n\nIn 2008, for Billboard magazine's 50th Anniversary, \"Family Affair\" was listed as the 79th best single on the The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. While at the end of 2009 was named the 12th most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. Rolling Stone ranked it number ninety-five on their list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s decade. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mary+J.+Blige/_/Family+Affair\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
