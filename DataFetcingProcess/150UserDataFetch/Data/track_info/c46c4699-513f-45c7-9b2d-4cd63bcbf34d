Musically, the song is standard 12-bar blues number with emphasis on live drumming by Sheila E., and a crunchy guitar sound. The song also features Sheena Easton, who sings co-lead with Prince. Prince sings in his sped-up \"Camille\" voice, although the song was not intended for the \"Camille\" album.\n\nThe music video for the song was included in the Sign “☮” the Times movie, and features the intro from the extended version of the song. The entire video is portrayed to be as a dream sequence by Prince, dozing off in his dressing room. In the U.S., the single went to the #2 position on the Billboard Hot 100 singles tally, the week of October 17, 1987. The single stayed in the Top 10 of the charts for six weeks.\n\nThe extended version of the song (called the \"Long Look\") is similar to the video but has an additional musical section in the middle of the song with Sheena Easton, and continues for a few more seconds instead of fading out at the end. The \"Long Look\" was included on the Ultimate compilation album in 2006.\n\nThe B-side of the single was the funky album track, \"Housequake.\" The song was considered for release as the first single from the unreleased \"Camille\" album, and therefore, arguably holds a place of importance in Prince's album history, considering the events that followed the creation of the track. The 12\" also included an extension of the song called \"7 Minutes Mo'Quake,\" which was a mostly instrumental version with the end of the album version tacked on. The remix is noteworthy for some of Atlanta Bliss's trumpet solos, which often were included in live versions of the song. Leaked versions of an unedited \"original version\" (often called \"Camille's Mix\") are attainable on the internet. Upon listening to them it is clear that the track required significant changes in the composition before arriving at the album version, which is now a fan favorite, and was often considered one of the standout tracks on the album.\n\nBoth songs are occasionally still performed in concert by Prince. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/U+Got+The+Look\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
