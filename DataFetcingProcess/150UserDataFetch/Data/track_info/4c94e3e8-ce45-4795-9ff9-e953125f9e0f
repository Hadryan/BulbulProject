While the Rolling Stones had already laid the track to tape, the Burrito Brothers' version was actually the first to be released, appearing on their second album, Burrito Deluxe, in April 1970- one year before \"Sticky Fingers.\"\n\nReleased as the second (U.S.-only) single in June 1971, \"Wild Horses\" reached #28 on the singles chart. Although popular at the Stones' live shows, \"Wild Horses\" has only been released in a reworked version on the 1995 acoustic/live album Stripped.\n\nIt has proven to be a popular cover song for other artists, eventually leading the Rolling Stones to re-release it as a single in 1996. It has been covered by Leon Russell, The Cranberries, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, Old and in the Way, The Sundays, Guns N' Roses, Bush, Labelle, The Lovemongers with Chris Cornell, Jewel, Dave Matthews, Garbage, Charlotte Martin, Chantal Kreviazuk, Alicia Keys ft. Adam Levine, Tre Lux, Iron & Wine, Stone Sour, Honeytribe, Sheryl Crow, Deacon Blue, Summerhill,Elisa and Natasha Bedingfield. Melanie Shafika.\n\nThe Sundays' version was used in a long-running Budweiser beer commercial in the early 1990s, featuring slow-motion footage of galloping Clydesdale horses. The version was also featured in the 1996 thriller Fear and a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode The Prom. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Wild+Horses\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
