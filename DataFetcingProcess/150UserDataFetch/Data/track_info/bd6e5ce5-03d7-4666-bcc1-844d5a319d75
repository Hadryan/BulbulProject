With production handled by Alex da Kid and Brandon Darner, the song is an indie rock song, and its lyrics describe how one should never change who they are.\n\nAfter the song was covered on Glee and heavy rotation in commercials and television shows, the song received commercial success and reached number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their first Top 40 single, as well as number four on the Alternative Songs chart and number three on the Rock Songs chart. It holds the longest run on the Billboard Alternative Top 10 for 2012 with 32 weeks. The single reached the top ten singles in Austria (#6), Belgium (#1), Czech Republic (#10), Ireland (#9), Japan (#7), Billboard Pop Songs (#10), and Portugal (#6).

He sat on it for a year and a half before one day he sat down at his computer, and  came up with its rhythm. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons/_/It%27s+Time\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
