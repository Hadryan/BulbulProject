The piece has also permeated popular culture, having been used as background music for such films as Gallipoli, television programmes and in advertisements to the point of becoming a cliché for self-consciously \"sad\" moments <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tomaso+Giovanni+Albinoni/_/Adagio+in+G+minor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
