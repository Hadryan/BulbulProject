Buckley, not wholly satisfied with any one take, recorded the song more than twenty times. Grammy Award-winning music studio engineer Andy Wallace took three of these recordings to create a single track. The result is a sparse-sounding production of vocals and electric guitar, influenced by John Cale's version.\n\nIn 2004, Jeff Buckley's version was ranked #259 on Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". In September 2007, a poll of fifty songwriters conducted by Q Magazine listed \"Hallelujah\" among the all-time \"Top 10 Greatest Tracks\" with John Legend calling Buckley's version \"as near perfect as you can get\". Buckley's first #1 came posthumously in March 2008 when \"Hallelujah\" topped Billboard's Hot Digital Songs following a performance of the song by Jason Castro on American Idol. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley/_/Hallelujah\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
