Some time after the album's release, Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl confirmed that was song was indeed written about Love in an exclusive interview with Mojo magazine.\n\nThe video for this song was the first Foo Fighters music video and was directed by Jerry Casale, who was a member of and directed videos for Devo.\n\nThe video shows the band performing the song in a room with a paper background while lights strobe and a giant spore floats around them. This is interspersed with footage of Dave Grohl eating chess pieces and brushing his teeth with what appears to be a butter knife (although there is no blood). The video was featured in an episode of Beavis and Butt-head.\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic included I'll Stick Around in his polka medley \"The Alternative Polka\", from Bad Hair Day. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/I%27ll+Stick+Around\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
