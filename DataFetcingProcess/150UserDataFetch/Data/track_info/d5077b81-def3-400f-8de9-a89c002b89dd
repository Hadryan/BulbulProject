The track was also released on the US edition of Fireball, in lieu of the UK version's track Demon's Eye.)\n\nThe song was originally called \"Prostitute\". Vocalist Ian Gillan introduced the song on Deep Purple in Concert: \"It was about a friend of ours who got mixed up with a very evil woman and it was a sad story. They got married in the end. And a few days after they got married, the lady died.\"\n\nWhen Deep Purple performed the song live, Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore would play a guitar-vocal duel in the middle. This would always end with an extremely long, high-pitched scream from Gillan, before the band returned to playing the original song.\n\nDuring the song \"You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget,\" on Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force's album Trial by Fire, Yngwie Malmsteen and Joe Lynn Turner, who replaced Gillan in Deep Purple around the same time the album was released, pay tribute to Gillan and Blackmore by incorporating this guitar-vocal battle into the song after the guitar solo. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple/_/Strange+Kind+of+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
