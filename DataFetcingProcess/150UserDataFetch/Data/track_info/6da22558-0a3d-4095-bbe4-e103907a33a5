It appears on the studio album Brothers in Arms, and also on the live album On The Night; the same live version is on Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits.\n\nThe trumpet introduction of the original recording was played by  Randy Brecker, while the saxophone part was played by Michael Brecker, both of The Brecker Brothers fame. As Mark Knopfler says on the Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits DVD, it is now widely used when people are trying out saxophones at music shops, just as Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven is widely used when trying out guitars. Having one of his songs used in such a way is something that he always dreamt of.\nMichael Brecker played the saxophone solo on the original recording, while Chris White played it live on the Brothers in Arms and On Every Street world tours. The saxophone introduction was also used in the theme music for the TVB series Files of Justice. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/_/Your+Latest+Trick\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
