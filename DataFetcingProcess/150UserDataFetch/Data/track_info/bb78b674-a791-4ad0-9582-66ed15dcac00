The song, about infidelity, was a hit for Cooke and has become a pop standard covered by numerous artists of different genres. It is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Cooke's recorded version has Lou Rawls singing responses as an uncredited background singer.\n\nThis song is considered by many historians of soul music to be the founding, or at least definitive soul song, as it provides the formula that is still popular today. Cooke's live version of this song that he performed in Miami, from the album Live at the Harlem Square Club, 1963, can be seen as his personal vision of what soul music should be, owing to the texture and emotion conveyed through his vocals that night, and that were probably standard in Cooke's near-nightly shows in primarily black clubs.\n\nThe most significant covers of the song include the hit versions by\n\n    * The Animals, Eddie Floyd, Mickey Gilley, Ben Mills, and most recently Scott Blasey.\n    * Lou Rawls, who sang background vocals on the original song, recorded his own charting version in 1970.\n    * In the United Kingdom, The Faces released this song as part of a medley with \"You Send Me\" and charted it on the UK Singles Chart at #7 as a double A-side with \"Farewell\".
