It was the first single from the soundtrack and premiered on radio stations across North America in November 2006 (see 2006 in music).\n\nIt also appears as the last track on Lavigne's third album, The Best Damn Thing which was released on April 17, 2007. Lavigne has described the rest of the album as being upbeat and heavy in comparison to \"Keep Holding On\". Originally, a different version was to be included, but the original version made it instead.\n\nThe song has been well-received by music critics, with Billboard describing it as a \"gorgeous song\" in which Lavigne seems to be \"set to remain for the long term\".\n\n\"Keep Holding On\" reached number two for four weeks on the Canadian BDS Airplay Chart, being kept off the top spot by Nelly Furtado's \"Say It Right\". It became her highest-peaking airplay single there since \"Complicated\" which peaked at #1 for 1 week in 2002. It peaked within the top 20 on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart, peaking at #17, and the top 10 on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks format chart. This feat is particularly impressive considering no official music video was made to promote it. It was not released in most of Europe, although it got to #9 in Slovakia, #27 in the Czech Republic and #32 in Latvia.\n\nThe track was one of the songs short-listed for the \"Best Original Song\" category at the 2007 Academy Awards, but it was not among the final nominees. The song was used in the season 2 finale of the American television series Ghost Whisperer.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Avril+Lavigne/_/Keep+Holding+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
