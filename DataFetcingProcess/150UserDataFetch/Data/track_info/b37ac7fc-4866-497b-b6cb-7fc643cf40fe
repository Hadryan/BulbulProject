The songs on Vespertine are introvert. I tried to make it frozen, winterlike. It's an inside album, a domestic album, I had loads and loads of beats for 'Hidden Place' but it still wasn't up enough. Matthew Herbert came for a visit in the studio and offered to do it. He ran away to his studio and came back after a few hours later with a DAT.\"\n\nWritten by Björk, Guy Sigsworth & Mark Bell. Produced by Björk. Hidden Place was not so hidden as it was the first single to be taken from the fourth studio album Vespertine (2001). The video marked also a new beginning as M/M Paris co directed the video with Inez & Vinoodh, and went on to collaboratively create the visuals and layout for the whole Vespertine album and a sequence of singles.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/_/Hidden+Place\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
