The guitar solo is ranked number 62 on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\n\"Money\" is notable for its introductory passage of cash registers dinging and coins clinking, much like \"Time\". However, unlike \"Time\", the 'money' sounds were recorded specifically for the album, and are featured in a 7/4 beat rhythm.\n\n\"Money\", a riff-driven song, is notable for the unusual 7 beat time signature. The song is also notable for its dramatic change to 4/4 time for an extended guitar solo, after which the song returns to 7/8, then ends in 4/4. Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour suggested the change in time signature was likely introduced to make things a little easier for him.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Money\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
