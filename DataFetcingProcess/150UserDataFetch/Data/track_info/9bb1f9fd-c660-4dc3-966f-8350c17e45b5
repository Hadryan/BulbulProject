The song features John Lennon singing lead, who is also the composer (though, as with all Beatles songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, alone or in collaboration, the song is credited to Lennon/McCartney).\nOne night in 1967, the phrase \"words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup\" came to Lennon after hearing his then-wife Cynthia, according to Lennon, \"going on and on about something.\" Later, after \"she'd gone to sleep—and I kept hearing these words over and over, flowing like an endless stream,\" Lennon went downstairs and turned it into a song. He began to write the rest of the lyrics and when he was done, he went to bed and forgot about them.\n    \"I was lying next to my first wife in bed, you know, and I was irritated. and I was thinking. She must have been going on and on about something and she'd gone to sleep and I kept hearing these words over and over, flowing like an endless stream. I went downstairs and it turned into a sort of cosmic song rather than an irritated song, rather than a 'Why are you always mouthing off at me?... [The words] were purely inspirational and were given to me as boom!. I don't own it you know; it came through like that.\"\nThe flavour of the song was heavily influenced by Lennon's and the Beatles' interest in Transcendental Meditation in late 1967 – early 1968, when the song was composed. Based on this he added the mantra \"Jai guru deva om\" (Sanskrit: जय गुरुदेव ॐ) to the piece, which became the link to the chorus. The Sanskrit phrase is a sentence fragment whose words could have many meanings. Literally it approximates as \"glory to the shining remover of darkness,\"[3] and can be paraphrased as \"Victory to God divine\", \"Hail to the divine guru\", or the phrase commonly invoked by the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in referring to his spiritual teacher \"All Glory to Guru Dev.\"[4]\n\nThe song's lyrical structure is straightforward: three repetitions of a unit consisting of a verse, the line \"Jai guru deva om\" and the line \"Nothing's gonna change my world\" repeated four times. The lyrics are highly image-based, with abstract concepts reified with phrases like thoughts \"meandering\", words \"slithering\", and undying love \"shining\". The title phrase \"across the universe\" appears at intervals to finish lines, although it never cadences, always appearing as a rising figure, melodically unresolved. It finishes on the leading note; to the Western musical ear, the next musical note would be the tonic and would therefore sound complete.\nIn his 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon referred to the song as perhaps the best, most poetic lyric he ever wrote: \"It's one of the best lyrics I've written. In fact, it could be the best. It's good poetry, or whatever you call it, without chewin' it. See, the ones I like are the ones that stand as words, without melody. They don't have to have any melody, like a poem, you can read them.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Across+the+Universe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
