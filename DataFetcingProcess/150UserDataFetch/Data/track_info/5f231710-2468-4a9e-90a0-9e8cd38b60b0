Like many young musicians in San Francisco, Slick did a lot of drugs. She saw lots of drug references in Carroll's book, including the pills, the smoking caterpillar, the mushroom, and lots of other images that are generally trippy. She noticed that lots of childrens stories involve a substance of some kind that alters reality, and felt it was time to write a song about it. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane/_/White+Rabbit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"White Rabbit\" was written by Grace Slick, who based the lyrics on Lewis Carroll's book Alice In Wonderland. Like many young musicians in San Francisco, Slick did a lot of drugs. She saw lots of drug references in Carroll's book, including the pills, the smoking caterpillar, the mushroom, and lots of other images that are generally trippy. She noticed that lots of childrens stories involve a substance of some kind that alters reality, and felt it was time to write a song about it.\n\nSlick got the idea for this after taking LSD and spending hours listening to the Miles Davis album Sketches Of Spain. The Spanish beat she came up with was also influenced by Maurice Ravel's \"Bolero.\"\n\nSlick wrote and performed this when she was in a band called The Great Society. She brought it with her, along with \"Somebody To Love,\" when she joined Jefferson Airplane in 1966.\n\nThis was used as the theme song for a 1973 movie called Go Ask Alice.\n\nThe UK version of the album didn't have this on it.\n\nThis was one of the defining songs of the 1967 \"Summer Of Love.\" As young Americans protested the Vietnam war and took a lot of drugs, this played in the background.\n\nOn an original recording by The Great Society, the song is barely recognizable due to Grace's higher voice before several throat operations that lowered her range after each one.\n\n\"Go Ask Alice\" which is a lyric from this song, inspired an anonymous author to put out a book with that same title. The book was a \"diary\" of a young girl in the 1960s who had a drug addiction and died. The diary owner's name is never given, and the diary is suspected to be fictional even after it was promoted as true, and the anonymous author is suspected to be Beatrice Sparks, the book's editor. \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nOne pill makes you larger\nAnd one pill makes you small,\nAnd the ones that mother gives you\nDon't do anything at all.\nGo ask Alice\nWhen she's ten feet tall.\n\nAnd if you go chasing rabbits\nAnd you know you're going to fall,\nTell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar\nHas given you the call.\nCall Alice\nWhen she was just small.\n\nWhen the men on the chessboard\nGet up and tell you where to go\nAnd you've just had some kind of mushroom\nAnd your mind is moving low.\nGo ask Alice\nI think she'll know.\n\nWhen logic and proportion\nHave fallen softly dead,\nAnd the White Knight is talking backwards\nAnd the Red Queen's \"off with her head!\"\nRemember what the dormouse said:\n\"Feed your head. Feed your head. Feed your head\"  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jefferson+Airplane/_/White+Rabbit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
