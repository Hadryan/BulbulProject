The song was released as a single in 1993.\n\nThe single failed to match the popularity of Dre's earlier hit, \"Nuthin' but a \"G\" Thang\", although it did reach number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1993 and number six (counting the twelve weeks spent) on the rap/hip-hop chart on that year's overall ranking. The song features a slowed-down interpolation of Funkadelic's \"(Not Just) Knee Deep\" as its bassline and features Jewell on vocals and RBX on chorus.\n\nThe song was a diss towards rappers Eazy-E, Dre's former accomplice; Tim Dog, an East Coast rapper who slighted the whole West Coast rap scene; and Luther (Luke) Campbell, whose track \"Fakin' Like Gangstas\" from his debut solo album I Got Shit On My Mind (featuring JT Money from the group Poison Clan) was taken personally for making references to some of the popular rappers in the \"gangsta\" category. Snoop Dogg later made peace between him and Luke in the song Hoez from Smokefest Underground. \"Fuck Wit' Dre Day\" has an accompanying music video directed by Dr. Dre.\nEazy-E retaliated on his next album It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa which contained the song \"Real Muthaphuckkin G's\", on which he makes fun of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg (calling them \"studio gangstas\"), and Death Row Records.\n\nTim Dog responded with \"Dog Baby\" and \"Bitch with a Perm\" — two tracks directed at Snoop Dogg. Tim Dog was angry at Snoop for his 2nd verse and line \"Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick\" at the end of the song, as well as the representation of the lines \"Fuck me in the ass!\" and \"Step to me and let me suck your dick!\" as \"things that Tim Dog would say\" in the skit track, \"The $20 Sack Pyramid\".\n\nLuther Campbell along with JT Money and then-upcoming artist Clayvoisie responded with the song \"Cowards in Compton\" (from Luke's second solo LP, In The Nude) and its accompanying video that parodied Dre's original premise as a member of the mid-1980s rap group World Class Wreckin' Cru. On which Tweedy Bird Loc dissed Luther on \"Fucc Miami\" including \"Tha Shiznit\" where Snoop retaliated.\n\n\"Fuck Wit' Dre Day\" was included as a single for the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos.\n\nSnoop Dogg used and originated the word \"bootylicious\" in this song almost a decade before the 2001 single of that name by Destiny's Child. However, in this song it means \"bad\" or \"weak\"; that is far different from the meaning Beyoncé Knowles gave it in her group's hit, which the Oxford English Dictionary Online used when it added \"bootylicious\" in 2004. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/Fuck+Wit+Dre+Day+(And+Everybody%27s+Celebratin%27)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
