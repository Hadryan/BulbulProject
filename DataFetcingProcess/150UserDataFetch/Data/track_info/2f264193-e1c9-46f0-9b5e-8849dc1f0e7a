According to the band, they were only familiar with Tony Tribe's version, and their version featured a lighter, reggae-style flavor compared to Diamond's somber, acoustic ballad. This version reached number one in the UK charts in August 1983, and number thirty-four in the U.S. in March 1984. A U.S. re-release in 1988 of the UB40 cover would then reach number one. This version of the song was featured on the Karaoke Revolution video game. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/UB40/_/Red+Red+Wine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
