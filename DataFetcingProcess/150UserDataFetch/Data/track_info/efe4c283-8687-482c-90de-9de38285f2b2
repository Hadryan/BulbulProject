DeLeo also wrote the song's music. DeLeo stated the following about \"Creep:\"\n\nMusically speaking I was thinking about a song along the lines of 'Heart Of Gold' by Neil Young, which is in the key of D-minor, the saddest key of all. Scott was thinking about the lyrics, and at that time in our lives we were struggling very much. What Scott was writing about was a real-life situation. Also about me, the thing about the gun. 'Creep' is a very demeaning word. It was one of those instances where we looked at ourselves, looked in the mirror.\n\nWhen Stone Temple Pilots released \"Creep\" as a single for the second time in 1993 (it was originally released before \"Plush\", but didn't chart well and Atlantic released it again after \"Plush\"), Weiland re-recorded the vocals for this song. There are four studio cuts of \"Creep\" as a result. The \"Original Album Version\" and its shorter edit \"Original Radio Version\", and the \"New Album Version\" and edited \"New Radio Version\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stone+Temple+Pilots/_/Creep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
