It peaked at number sixteen in South Africa. Lavigne did not promote the single, and consequently it failed to chart on U.S. Billboard Hot 100; it peaked at number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, and at number fifty-five on the Billboard Pop 100; However without video the single played a lot in radios all over US, Canada and Latinamerica. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Avril+Lavigne/_/Fall+to+Pieces\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
