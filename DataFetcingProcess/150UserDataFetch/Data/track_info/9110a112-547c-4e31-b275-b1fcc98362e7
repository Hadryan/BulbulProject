This version peaked at #20 on the Hot 100. It hit #1 in New Zealand.\n\nIn 2000, the song has been covered in a ska-punk version by Voodoo Glow Skulls on their album Symbolic. It was also covered by former American Idol contestant Jason Castro in 2008.\n\nIn 2004, Tom Morello, under his persona, The Nightwatchman, borrowed and changed lyrics from the song during his performance of Until the End, as part of the Axis of Justice Concert Series Volume  The lyrics he used were: \"...three times I shot the sheriff; and did not spare the deputy\". A studio version of the song was later released on his album One Man Revolution.\n\n\nBoth Inner Circle's \"Bad Boys\" and Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" refer to a \"Sheriff John Brown\". In \"I Shot the Sheriff\", Brown is the shooting victim; in \"Bad Boys\", one line asks \"What'cha gonna do/When the Sheriff John Brown come for you\".\"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley/_/I+Shot+The+Sheriff\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
