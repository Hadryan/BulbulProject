And it really doesn't matter if you're here without them for all day or all month. It's just kind of about the lonely and missing of somebody, but people kind of take that sort of as a little bit of a sad song. And in a way, I kind of meant it as a happy song. And the reason being because it's talking about being here without you, but she's still with me in my dreams. 'And tonight, it's only you and me,' so the song was really just about that dream. And being in a state of peace, because you've got that person there with you in your sleep. And in that way I kind of meant for it to be a little bit of a happy song.\"\nIt's One Of The Greatest Hit Song By 3 Doors Down And The Song Have Been Popular Around The Globe. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/3+Doors+Down/_/Here+Without+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
