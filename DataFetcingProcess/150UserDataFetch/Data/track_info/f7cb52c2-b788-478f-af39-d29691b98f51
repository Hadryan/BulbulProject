Speaking with Songfacts  about this song in an interview, co-writer Rob Hyman explained Cyndi came up with the title when she saw it in the magazine TV Guide. \"Time After Time\" was the name of a 1979 science fiction movie starring Malcolm McDowell as a man who invents a time machine. Said Rob: \"When she saw 'Time After Time,' something clicked - she said 'I think I have a title.' I was sitting at the piano and just started banging out what would eventually be the chorus, hook, and the way we sing it. It almost had like a Reggae feel, it was a little bouncier and a little more upbeat. We started getting off on that chorus, then the verse melodies started to appear. It's a deceptively simple song.\"\n\nIt reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart on June 9, 1984, and remained there for two weeks. Worldwide, the song is her most commercially successful single after \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", and reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart and number 6 on the RIAA Singles Chart.\n\n\"Time After Time\" was nominated for \"Song of the Year\" at the 1985 Grammy Awards. The ballad is considered a classic of the 1980s and is still played frequently on adult contemporary radio. It has been covered by numerous artists.\n\nWriting\n\nLauper co-wrote \"Time After Time\" with Philadelphia rocker Rob Hyman of The Hooters, who also supplied backup vocals to the song. In a 2006 interview with Sound Off with Matt Pinfield (episode 212) on HDNet, Lauper related how the song was written. She indicated much of the lyrics were written about occurrences in the studio and her life at the time. The line \"the second hand unwinds\" referred to producer Rick Chertoff's watch which was winding backwards.\n\nHyman explained in the interview with Songfacts that he and Lauper stayed in the studio after the sessions composing the song.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe video for \"Time After Time\" was about a runaway leaving her lover behind. The video opens with Lauper watching the 1936 film The Garden of Allah. Lauper signs the title of the song to the deaf as she is leaving the train station. The video was played in heavy rotation on MTV. Lauper's mother, brother, and then-boyfriend David Wolff appear in the video, and Lou Albano, who played her father in the \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" video, can be seen as a cook. The video was directed by Edd Griles. Portions of the video were filmed at the now closed Tom's Diner in Roxbury, the intersection of Central Ave & Main St in Wharton, New Jersey, and at the Morristown train station.\n\nThe \"house\" scenes shot with Cyndi's mother were filmed at two houses on Hurd Street in Wharton. The kitchen scene was filmed in Mary Sweedy's kitchen, complete with a wood/gas stove and the front porch was the house nextdoor, owned by her son Lenny. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cyndi+Lauper/_/Time+After+Time\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
