It is built around a Latin guitar, Latin chord, and also makes subtle use of Latin percussion in the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional contemporary R&B-style beat. Its protagonist declares she would give \"her all\" to have just one more night with her estranged lover.

It is built around a Latin guitar, Latin chord, and also makes subtle use of Latin percussion in the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional contemporary R&B-style beat. Its protagonist declares she would give \"her all\" to have just one more night with her estranged lover. It was released as the album's fifth and final single in 1998. \"My All\" at the time set a record, giving Carey her thirteenth number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the most by any female recording artist.\n\nThe song ranks among one of Carey's most remixed tracks. The main R&B remix of this single is the So So Def remix, which features re-recorded vocals by Carey. The song's main dance remix is by David Morales. Known as the Classic Club mix, it is Carey's first collaboration with Morales for which she did not record entirely new vocals.\n\nCarey recorded a Spanish version of \"My All\", \"Mi Todo\" and it was released outside the U.S. on the \"My All\" single and the Latin American versions of Butterfly. Unlike \"Hero\" (1993) and \"Open Arms\" (1996), Carey recorded the Spanish version of the song in a different key from the original English version.\n\n\nThe single's video, shot entirely in black and white and on location in Puerto Rico, was one of the last music videos directed by fashion photographer Herb Ritts before he died. The images of Carey lying in the shell and in front of the flowers were inspired by Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/My+All\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
