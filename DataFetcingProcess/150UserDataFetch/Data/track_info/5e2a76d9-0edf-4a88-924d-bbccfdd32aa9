The album reached #9 on the 'Billboard 200' list and then reached triple platinum in America.\n\n\"Your Love\" was their first single from the album. It reached #6 on the 'Billboard Hot 100' chart as well as #7 on the 'Mainstream Rock' chart, and it became their signature song. It went on to be featured in a number of 80s-themed compilation albums, and over 1,000 covers and remixes by other artists have been released online. Some of them, such as \"Use Your Love\" by Katy Perry, change around the name. Perry has cited the original tune as one of her favorite songs.\n\nLike its musical contemporaries Naked Eyes and The Fixx, The Outfield had success in the U.S. with their 80s songs but failed to do so in their homeland. More recently, the song has had renewed popularity from to its inclusion in the well-received \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" video game soundtrack. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Outfield/_/Your+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
