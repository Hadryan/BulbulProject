The song quickly became a concert staple for the group, a live version appearing later on the posthumous album An American Prayer and that same version, which has been called \"probably one of the best live performances of any song\", again on In Concert and Greatest Hits. During this version, Jim Morrison talks for a short while to a female audience member about his Zodiac sign and, with a sudden, ironic twist that causes the audience to erupt in laughter, denounces his beliefs in it. The song was also featured twice in the movie The Doors; the studio version in the film, and the aforementioned live version over the end credits.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Doors/_/Roadhouse+Blues\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
