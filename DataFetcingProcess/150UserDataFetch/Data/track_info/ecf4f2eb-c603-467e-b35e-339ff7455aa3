The song was written by Banshees members Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin and it was released as the second single from the band's third album Kaleidoscope.\n\n\"Christine\" and the Kaleidoscope album marked a change in musical direction for Siouxsie & the Banshees, with the arrival of the guitarist John McGeoch. The close of the song utilizes a strong flanging effect.\n\nLyrically the song continued the band's exploration with mental illness (as they did on previous single \"Happy House\"), as it describes Christine, a woman with \"22 faces\" (\"...Personality changes behind her red smile / Every new problem brings a stranger inside / Helplessly forcing one more new disguise...\"). The song was inspired by the story of Christine Costner-Sizemore, whose battle with dissociative identity disorder was dramatized in the film The Three Faces of Eve. Two of Christine's identities, the Strawberry Girl and the Banana Split Lady, are mentioned in the lyrics of the song.\n\nThe single peaked at number twenty-two in the UK singles chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees/_/Christine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
