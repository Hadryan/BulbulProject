It was written and sung by John Lennon (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and released on the album Help! in August 1965.\nThe song shows the influence of the American singer Bob Dylan. The song \"is just basically John doing Dylan\", McCartney later said.  Lennon seems to mimic Dylan's gruff vocal style: the song is in a folkish strophic form and uses a Dylanesque acoustic guitar figure in compound time, chiefly acoustic accompaniment, no backing voices and light percussion from brushed snare, tambourine and maraca. The lyrics of Dylan's 1964 song \"I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Have Never Met)\" open with a strikingly similar image: \"I can't understand, she let go of my hand, and left me here facing the wall\", as compared with Lennon's \"Here I stand head in hand, turn my face to the wall\".\n\n\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\" was the first Beatles song to feature an outside musician (apart from \"Love Me Do\", the group's first EMI recording, in which producer George Martin had engaged a session drummer to substitute for the then-untried Ringo Starr). The basic rhythm track was recorded first, followed by Harrison's guitar and some extra percussion. John Scott recorded a tenor flute in the spaces in Lennon's vocal track and an additional alto flute part, in harmony with the first, on the last available track of the four-track machine. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/You%27ve+Got+to+Hide+Your+Love+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
