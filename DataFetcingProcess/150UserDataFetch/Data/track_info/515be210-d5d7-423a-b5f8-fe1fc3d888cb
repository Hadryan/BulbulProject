It appears on several studio albums and is a constant in his live shows. Its angular and slightly discordant style show a break with previous jazz forms, as well as with contemporaneous bebop composers. In addition to providing a perfect showcase for Monk's improvisations, though, the driving yet slightly off-balance tune has proven consistently popular and is now a standard among jazz musicians everywhere. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thelonious+Monk/_/Epistrophy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Thelonious Monk composed the jazz standard Epistrophy, often considered his signature tune, in 1942.
