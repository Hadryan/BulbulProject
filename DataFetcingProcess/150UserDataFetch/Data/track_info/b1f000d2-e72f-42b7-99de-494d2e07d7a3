It was released as the album's second single on November 28 2005. The lyrics are mainly in Icelandic, with some lines sung in Vonlenska (\"Hopelandic\"). Written with spaces, the song's title would be \"Hoppa í polla\" (the \"—a\" in \"hoppa\" is not pronounced). As with many of the band's songs, it was given a nickname in the early stages of writing. Hoppípolla was \"The Money Song\", as the band was certain they had written a song which would have commercial success. The single also featured a studio remake of \"Hafssól\", a song previously released on the band's 1997 debut album, ''Von''. The title appears as \"Hafsól\" on the single.\n\n\"Hoppípolla\" was used in 2006 advertisements for the BBC's ''Planet Earth'' TV series, giving the band one of its rare exposures to a mainstream audience. When Sir David Attenborough received his National Television lifetime achievement award, the piece was used for the moving anthology of his work, made especially for the occasion. Following this, there has been a high demand for the single, which has led to a re-publishing of the commercial version in May 2006, distributed by EMI. The re-release of the single brought critical acclaim for the band in the mainstream music media, including being named Jungalist Single of the Week on 1 May 2006. The song was used in the closing credits of the BBC's coverage of the 2006 FA Cup final, and BBC News 24 also used it to promote their coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The song was also featured in the ''Doctor Who Confidential'' episode \"End of an Era\". The song is also currently being used in a trailer for the DisneyNature/BBC documentary film \"Earth\"; the film is created by the same people who made \"Planet Earth\".\n\nBesides its repeated use by the BBC, the song was used in the ''Children of Men'' trailer, the film ''Penelope'', and an Oxfam]advert. The song was recently covered by We Are Scientists on their B-sides album ''Crap Attack''.\n\nA promotional music video for \"Hoppípolla\" was made in November 2005. It was directed by Arni & Kinski and first aired during the week of November 21 2005.\n\nIt depicts two childlike groups of friends - who are actually elderly people - strolling around a town and pulling pranks on other people just like children. Near the end of the video, the two groups meet each other in a graveyard to battle with water balloons and wooden swords. When one of them is injured and gets a bloody nose (which is referenced in the lyrics), the opponents run away in fear, while the others celebrate the victory.  The video shows several shots of the friends jumping in puddles of water.\n\nBand members Kjartan Sveinsson and Jón Þór Birgisson are featured in the video: Kjartan plays the victim of a Ding Dong Ditch trick, and Jónsi plays the cashier at a shop where an old man steals and eats some produce. Drummer Orri Páll Dýrason can be seen repairing his bicycle and Georg Hólm can be seen cleaning. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sigur+R%C3%B3s/_/Hopp%C3%ADpolla\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
