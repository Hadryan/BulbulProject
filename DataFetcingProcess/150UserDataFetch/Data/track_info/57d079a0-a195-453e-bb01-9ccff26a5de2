Originally written for the soundtrack of 1998 film 'City of Angels', staring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan, the song was later included on the band's sixth album Dizzy Up the Girl. The acoustic guitar in the song gives a distinctive sound as it is in an odd tuning, with 5 of the 6 strings tuned to D. This gives a ringing effect similar to a 12-string guitar. \"Iris\" has been one of the Goo Goo Dolls' most defining song in terms of its contribution to the band's future success. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Goo+Goo+Dolls/_/Iris\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Iris\" is a song by American alternative rock band the Goo Goo Dolls.
