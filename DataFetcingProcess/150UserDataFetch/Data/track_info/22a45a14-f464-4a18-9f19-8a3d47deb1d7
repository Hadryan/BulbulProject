Supposedly, the members of Black Sabbath put together this song in 15 minutes based on a solo by Tony Iommi. This song was only meant to be a \"filler\", but became one of Black Sabbath's most well known songs: the band members were sent back to the studio to record one more song because the record company deemed the album was too short, and planned to quickly record a filler song, but eventually wrote and recorded \"Paranoid\". The record company changed the album's name from War Pigs, as it was originally intended, to Paranoid out of fear of a backlash from supporters of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Paranoid\" was released as a single and received regular airplay on mainstream radio. The single, with \"The Wizard\" on the B-side, was released in the UK in July 1970 and it reached the number 4.\n\nLead singer Ozzy Osbourne continued to play this song in concert during his career as a solo artist.\n\n\"Paranoid\" was ranked #34 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs. In March 2005, Q magazine placed it at number 11 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. Rolling Stone ranked it #250 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It is #1 in the book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/_/Paranoid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
