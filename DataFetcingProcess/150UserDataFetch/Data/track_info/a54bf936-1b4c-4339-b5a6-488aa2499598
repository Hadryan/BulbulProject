Nellee Hooper and Björk produced it together, and released it in 1995 on Björk's second album \"Post\". To direct this video, Michel Gondry was once again called in for his unique visual style. The song was also based on the sonority of Elis Regina and later dedicated to her. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/_/Isobel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
