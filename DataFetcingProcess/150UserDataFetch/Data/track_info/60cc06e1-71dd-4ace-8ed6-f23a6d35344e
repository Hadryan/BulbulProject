It was written by Gallagher in the summer of 2004, before the band made their final attempt at recording what would become Don't Believe the Truth. He got the title from the book of the same name, which he found whilst cleaning out his garage (it belonged not to him but to girlfriend Sara McDonald). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/The+Importance+of+Being+Idle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
