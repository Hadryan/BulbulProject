The song features lyrics written by guitarist Kim Thayil and music written by drummer Matt Cameron. It was also the first Soundgarden song to be recorded and released with bassist Ben Shepherd. The re-recorded version of the song featured on Badmotorfinger includes the addition of a horn section featuring Scott Granlund (saxophone) and Ernst Long (trumpet).\n\nThayil on \"Room a Thousand Years Wide\":\n\n\"I really liked the music to the song and it needed words, and since no one else pursued it, I decided to. It's not really about things that have actually happened to me. It's more about experience in general. I've heard a lot of good ideas from people telling me what it's about. They said it's about God, Satan, Jesus, Satan, both, it's religious, it isn't religious...The truth is, it's just me.\"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden/_/Room+a+Thousand+Years+Wide\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
