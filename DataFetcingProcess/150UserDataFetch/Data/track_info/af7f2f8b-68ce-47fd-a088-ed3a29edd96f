He formed Deftones initially as a way to come to grips with his \"Inner Black Beauty\".\n\nMusic: The intro as well the verses are composed of low guitar and a bit loud drums and bass with keyboards effects driving into heavy choirs who expands every time that they arrive. \"Change\" would become one of the most well known songs by Deftones.\n\nMeaning: \"It's a metaphorical song. You could take it in the literal sense of me watching someone turn into a fly and taking them home with me and pulling of their wings and laughing. It spawns from me being a complete a--hole and getting the complete repercussion for it by having my life taken away.\" - Chino. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/_/Change+(In+the+House+of+Flies)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
