The single was Dayne's first major exposure, and she soon became known for her up-tempo, dance-oriented music. \"Tell It to My Heart\" appeared in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 the week of 14 November 1987, rising to #39 from #43. Ten weeks later, during the week of 23 January 23, 1988, the single peaked in the number seven spot. The song was on the Billboard Hot 100 for 26 weeks. The song peaked number 4 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. In the UK, \"Tell It To My Heart\" reached #3. It was ranked as the 23rd best-selling single of 1988 in the UK. In 1995, \"Tell It to My Heart'\" was remixed and re-released to promote Dayne's Greatest Hits package. This version climbed to #23 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song was written by Ernie Gold and Chappell Music staff songwriter Seth Swirsky. Swirsky almost didn't deliver the song to his publisher after he and his girlfriend decided it was not good enough.\n\n\"Tell It To My Heart\" reached Taylor Dayne when Dayne contacted Chappell Music and asked to be sent some demos which had been overlooked, although the song had been recorded in early 1987 by Louisa Florio for a self-titled Canadian album release. Dayne recalled feeling an immediate affinity with the song: \"I thought there was something about the hook - it's a happy hook.\" The track was recorded at Cove City Sound Studios in Glen Cove, Long Island. When Seth Swirsky received a copy of the original master track from Arista Records president Clive Davis, Swirsky opined that having four bars before the bridge was too short. Davis obliged Swirsky's requested addition of four bars to allow the bridge to \"breathe\".\n\nThe track took off so unexpectedly in the fall of 1987 that Taylor was forced to complete her debut album at Cove City Sound in six weeks. Swirsky would also write, along with Arnie Roman, Dayne's follow-up single \"Prove Your Love\". For almost two months, only the 12-inch record of \"Tell It to My Heart\" with four mixes was available for purchase. That 12-inch sold 900,000 copies alone. Dayne was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal, Female for her performance on \"Tell It to My Heart\" in 1988. \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Dayne/_/Tell+It+to+My+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
