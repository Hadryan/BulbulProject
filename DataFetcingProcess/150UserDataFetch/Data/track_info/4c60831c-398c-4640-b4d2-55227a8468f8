This song also incorporated a use of more electronic music elements.\n\nThe single became Siouxsie & the Banshees' second top twenty hit, peaking at number seventeen in the UK singles chart.\n\nLater, the song's introduction was sampled by the band Mindless Self Indulgence for the song \"Bitches\". The Italian dance act Cappella was sued in 1993 for using the distinctive riff from \"Happy House\" in their song \"U Got 2 Know\" in the early 90's, without paying publishings and they lost. European band Ginger Ale also covered the song in 2003. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees/_/Happy+House\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
