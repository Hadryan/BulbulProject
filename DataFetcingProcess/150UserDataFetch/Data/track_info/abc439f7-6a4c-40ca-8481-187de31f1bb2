It was the second single from their 1998 album, Stunt.\n\nSteven Page apparently wrote this song after being embarrassed at how \"wordy\" his song, Brian Wilson, was. He decided he wanted to write something with a simple phrase like \"woo hoo hoo\" in the chorus.\n\nAlthough not as popular as their previous single, \"One Week\", it was used as the theme song for the TV series Baby Blues. The song is also notable for being one of, if not the first Barenaked Ladies song feature an electric guitar solo by Ed Robertson.\n\nThe video was directed by Doug Aitken and was filmed in the former house of comedian Andrew Dice Clay. The concept of the video was that it was seen from the point of view of various household pets (a cat, a dog, a goldfish, and a bird). Robertson was particularly disappointed with the filming of the video while it was being shot, as he didn't feel it was capturing the feeling of the concept.\n\nDuring promotion for the album the song was performed on all three big NBC late night shows. Saturday Night Live, Late Night with Conan O'Brien (notable for Steve's messing up by repeating a pre-chorus) and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, where earlier guest, actor David Duchovny joined the band for the song, playing an egg shaker. The band had arranged it with the actor after an impromptu meeting a week earlier while shooting a television guest appearance at a studio lot. The band suggested that Duchovny (whose series The X-Files was referenced in \"One Week\") should perform with them after discovering that they'd both be on the Tonight Show.\n\nThe song was also used to open the setlist of the band's Stunt tour, and has been used to open many shows since.\n\nThe intro has also been used on the Argos adverts of 2004 and 2005. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/It%27s+All+Been+Done\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
