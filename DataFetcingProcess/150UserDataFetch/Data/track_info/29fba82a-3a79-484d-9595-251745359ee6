The line, \"We call it riding the gravy train\" is held for such a long time to emphasize the fact that these companies will go as long as possible to squeeze every last cent out of their clients. Vocals on the studio recording of this track were contributed by British folk singer Roy Harper, who was in the Abbey Road studios while Wish You Were Here was being recorded. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Have+a+Cigar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Much like \"Welcome To The Machine,\" this song is about corporations and how they control their musicians. The line, \"We call it riding the gravy train\" is held for such a long time to emphasize the fact that these companies will go as long as possible to squeeze every last cent out of their clients. Vocals on the studio recording of this track were contributed by British folk singer Roy Harper, who was in the Abbey Road studios while Wish You Were Here was being recorded. The Have a Cigar Songfacts states that this was one of the last songs added to Wish You Were Here . The song is represented on the back cover in the image of a salesman standing in a desert offering Pink Floyd albums. The salesman had no body or soul, which is how they felt about their record company. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Have+a+Cigar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
