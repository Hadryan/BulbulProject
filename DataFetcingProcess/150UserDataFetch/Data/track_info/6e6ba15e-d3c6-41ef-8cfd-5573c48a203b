The single is due to release on Record Store Day's Black Friday, November 28, 2014. It is the band's first release of new studio recorded material since Album of the Year (1997), breaking a 17-year hiatus.\n\n\nBackground and release\n\n\"Motherfucker\" was first played on a concert in July 2014's British Summer Time Hyde Park, along with another new song called \"Superhero\". Bassist Billy Gould later revealed on an interview to Rolling Stone that the band is on the way to release a new album on April 2015, also stating \"Motherfucker\" was going to be the first single from it, with a limited print of 5,000 seven-inch copies on Record Store Day. It will also feature a remix by J. G. Thirlwell on the B-side. The cover artwork is made by Cali Dewitt with a photograph by James Gritz.\n\n\n\nOn the song, keyboardist Roddy Bottum stated:\n\nIt feels apt that the first track we're releasing is \"Motherfucker,\" a song about accountability. Basically we've created, recorded and mixed a new body of work by ourselves and we're releasing it on our own label. It's a huge deal for us to only have ourselves to answer to at this point in our career and the song is about that, where the buck stops via the basic imagery of foie gras production, bondage. . .y'know, stuff like that.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nFaith No More\nMike Bordin – drums, percussion\nBilly Gould – bass, production\nRoddy Bottum – vocals, keyboards\nMike Patton – vocals\nJon Hudson – guitars <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/_/Motherfucker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
