Co-written by Stevie Wonder and the songwriters-producers Henry Cosby and Sylvia Moy, the song was an autobiographical account by Stevie Wonder about a woman he was fascinated with while in school at the Michigan School for the Blind in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nThe song was originally written as \"Oh My Marcia\" but Moy told Stevie to change the name from Marcia to cherie amour. The song became a #4 hit on both the Billboard pop and R&B singles charts in 1969. The song has been covered by fellow Motown act The Jackson 5, as well as by vocalists Andy Williams for his 1969 RIAA-certified gold album Get Together with Andy Williams and Billy Eckstine for his 1971 album Feel the Warm. Its familiar bass line has also been used in several other songs, most notably Until You Come Back to Me by Aretha Franklin and Soul Inspiration by Anita Baker.\n\nMy Cherie Amour is played on the Miss Dior Cherie commercial starring Elvis Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough.\n\nStevie Wonder's song in DTV was set to Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder/_/My+Cherie+Amour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
