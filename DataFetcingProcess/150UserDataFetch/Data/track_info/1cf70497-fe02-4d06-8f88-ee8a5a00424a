This live version of the song (as well as the live version of \"Bring Your Daughter...To the Slaughter\") is taken from the live album A Real Live One. The single reached number 5 in the UK charts. The live version of \"Hooks in You\" was recorded at the Wembley Arena, London, UK on the 17th of December 1990. When Iron Maiden plays this song live the crowd sings along to the intro and in large venues they can be louder than the band itself. A good example is the performance of Fear of the Dark at Rock In Rio.\n\nThe song has been covered by German a cappella metal band van Canto on their album Hero, and by Fighstar in the \"Maiden Heaven\" tribute album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/_/Fear+of+the+Dark\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
