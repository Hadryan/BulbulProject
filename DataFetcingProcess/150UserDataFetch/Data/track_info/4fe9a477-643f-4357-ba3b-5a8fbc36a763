It debuted at Number One on the UK Singles Chart on 23 October. The release of the song and its rise to number one further increased the ever-growing hype surrounding the band, and it was two weeks before they reached the cover of NME magazine. The single was released during a sell-out UK tour, although the band were playing at significantly smaller venues to those at which they would perform only months later.\n\nThe title track also features on the band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, which was released on 23 January 2006 - one week after their second single - \"When the Sun Goes Down\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/_/I+Bet+You+Look+Good+on+the+Dancefloor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
