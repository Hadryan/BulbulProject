The single was released in 2004.\nThe song reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and stayed there for 9 weeks. It also became their sole #1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, due to its somewhat heavier sound than some of their other material. \"Slither\" also charted at #56 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Velvet Revolver's highest charting song and the highest charting song that Scott Weiland has appeared on.\nMost famous for its instantly recognizable opening bass riff and its unmistakable guitar riff, it is arguably the bands signature song, and is frequently the closer to their shows. It was awarded a Grammy in 2005 for Best Hard Rock Performance, an award Weiland had won with his previous band, Stone Temple Pilots, for the song \"Plush\" in 1994. In 2009, \"Slither\" was ranked at #85 on VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\n\nThe song is played in Drop D Tuning on the album.\nThe song/riff was written by Slash during the time they were auditioning singers, it only just made the album as the others weren't that interested. When Scott came in to the band, he \"picked up on it right away\". \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Velvet+Revolver/_/Slither\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
