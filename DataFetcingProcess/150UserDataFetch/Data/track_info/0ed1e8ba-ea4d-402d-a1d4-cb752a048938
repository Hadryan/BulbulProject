Both versions of the 12\" (and also the edited 7\") also include the song \"1963\". \"True Faith\" is one of New Order's most popular songs.\nThe single peaked at number four in the United Kingdom on its original release in 1987. The single also became the first New Order single to chart on the Hot 100 in the United States that same year and their first ever Top 40 hit, peaking at number 32.\nA \"True Faith\" remix 12\" single and CD single were released in 1994, and another \"True Faith\" remix 12\" single and CD single were released in 2001. The 1994 remix charted in the UK at number 9.\n\n\nOriginal releases\n\nNew Order wrote and recorded \"True Faith\" and \"1963\" during a 10-day studio session with producer Stephen Hague. The two songs were written as new material for New Order's first singles compilation album, Substance 1987. After the two songs were recorded, the band's US management decided that \"True Faith\" was the stronger track and would be released as the new single, with \"1963\" as the B-side. \"1963\" was remixed and issued as a single in its own right in 1994.\n\"True Faith\" was never used as a track on a regular album, though it did appear on most of New Order's \"best of\" collections (Substance 1987, The Best of New Order, Retro, Singles and International). The first public performance of the song took place at the 1987 Glastonbury Festival; this version appears on the group's BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert album.\nThe original 7\" version of the song did not appear on any album until 2011's \"Total from Joy Division to New Order\".\n\n\nCover versions\n\nThe Boo Radleys as \"Boo!
