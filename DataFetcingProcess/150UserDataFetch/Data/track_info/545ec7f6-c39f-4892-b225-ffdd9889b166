This song is about the suicide of friend and Associates singer Billy Mackenzie in 1997.\n\n\"Cut Here\" was originally going to be the B-Side with \"Signal to Noise\" being the A-Side. This fact was confirmed in Join the Dots, with an acoustic version of \"Signal to Noise\" being intended to be on Greatest Hits before the switch. \"Signal to Noise\" was played live in The Cure's 2005 festivals because returning member Porl Thompson really liked the song. It was one of the rare B-Sides to be performed live regularly. (The last was \"The Big Hand\" in 1992.) \"Cut Here\" was played sparringly at festivals from 2001-2002 and has not been played since.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. \"Cut Here\"\n   2. \"Signal to Noise\"\n   3. \"Cut Here\" (Missing Remix)\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Robert Smith: vocals, guitar, 6-string bass, keyboards\n    * Simon Gallup: bass\n    * Perry Bamonte: guitar\n    * Roger O'Donnell: keyboards\n    * Jason Cooper: drums\n\n\nReleased - October 16, 2001\nGenre - Rock\nLength - 4:10\nLabel - Fiction Records\nProducer - Robert Smith <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Cut+Here\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
