Fagen's lyrics reference futuristic concepts such as solar-powered cities, a transatlantic tunnel, permanent space stations,[3] and spandex jackets.\n\n\"I.G.Y.\" debuted on the Billboard Top 40 on October 30, 1982, eventually peaking at number 26.[1]:217 It also reached number 8 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, number 17 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and number 54 on Billboard's R&B Singles chart. It was Fagen's only solo Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[4] It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1983,[5] losing to \"Always on My Mind\".[6]\n\n\"I.G.Y\" has been covered by artists such as British singer and musician Howard Jones, who included a version on his 1993 greatest hits album The Best of Howard Jones.[7]\n\nThe gospel a cappella group Take 6 covered \"I.G.Y.\" as the title track on their 2002 release Beautiful World. The lyrics of Fagen's original song were modified to recast the song with a gospel message.[8]\n\nThe song was also used in a scene from the Simpsons episode \"Future Drama\" where Homer and Bart are flying around in the 'imperfect Hovercar.'\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Donald+Fagen/_/I.G.Y.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
