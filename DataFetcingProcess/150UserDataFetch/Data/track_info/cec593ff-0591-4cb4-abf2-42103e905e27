Presley's record had stood 36 years.\n\nHowever, two weeks after \"End of the Road\" left the top spot, Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" reached number one, and remained there 14 weeks, one week longer than \"End of the Road\". Boyz II Men's new record stood only 17 weeks. The group's next single (\"I'll Make Love to You\"), however, would tie Houston's record, and 1995's Boyz II Men/Mariah Carey collaboration \"One Sweet Day\" would break it, logging 16 consecutive weeks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Boyz+II+Men/_/End+of+the+Road\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
