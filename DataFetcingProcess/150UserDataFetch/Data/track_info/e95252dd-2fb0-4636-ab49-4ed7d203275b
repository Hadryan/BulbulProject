The song's lyrics and arrangement were refined several times over the next two years, with no two pre-In Utero live renditions sounding alike. The earliest versions of the song, including the 1991 studio version, even feature an additional verse and chorus.\n\nThe In Utero version was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. It features Kera Schaley on cello. It was remixed, along with \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and later \"Pennyroyal Tea,\" by Scott Litt prior to the album's release, with Cobain asserting that the vocals and bass sounded \"mushy\" in the unmastered Albini recording. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/All+Apologies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
