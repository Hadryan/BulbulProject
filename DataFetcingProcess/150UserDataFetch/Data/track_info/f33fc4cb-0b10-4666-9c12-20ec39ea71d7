The band performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Later With Jools Holland, and Last Call with Carson Daly. The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero: World Tour.\n\nAn alternate version of the song, with a length of 7:27, was played on XMU before the shorter version was played on FM and other XM channels. This version was featured on their demo CD (which featured early versions of four tracks).\n\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video for \"Lazy Eye\" was directed by Suzie Vlcek, who directed the band's \"Kissing Families\" video as well as the video for Tegan and Sara's \"The Con\". It was produced by Eric Morgan. The music video is said to be a take on the 1970 Swedish film 'A Swedish Love Story'.\n\nIt takes place in a club, possibly in the 1970s or 1980s judging by the hairstyles and clothing, brimming with teenagers dancing to the song as the band plays live on stage. The video alternates between the band playing, and a young girl with short hair.\n\nThe girl notices a boy that shows up, she first ignores him and dances with another guy, notably when the song takes an angrier tone. The boy leaves, and waits outside, talking with friends. The girl eventually leaves the club, and sees him outside waiting, just like she waited for him. This reveals to her that he really does care about her, and they leave in good temper.\n\nFormer band member Jack Kennedy also makes an appearance as the bartender.\n\nThe video received airplay from MTV, VH1, Fuse, MTVU, and International Music Feed.\n\nReleased-September 16, 2007\nRecorded-Beer Wine Fish, Echo Park; Sunset Sound, Hollywood, California, 2006\nGenre-Indie rock, dream pop, shoegaze\nLength-5:54\nLabel-Dangerbird\nWriter(s)-Silversun Pickups\nProducer-Dave Cooley <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Silversun+Pickups/_/Lazy+Eye\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
