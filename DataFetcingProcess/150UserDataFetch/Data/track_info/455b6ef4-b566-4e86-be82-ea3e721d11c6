The song reached #8 on the U.S. charts, #6 in the U.K. and #3 in Australia and Canada. It was based in part on a rehearsal riff the band used for sound-checks.\n\nThe drum-driven single was recorded live at Dodger Stadium (without an audience) in Los Angeles, California in collaboration with the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band. The performance was also filmed for the song's music video. John McVie was in Tahiti during the Dodger Stadium recording, but he is represented in the video by a cardboard cutout carried around by Mick Fleetwood and later positioned in the stands with the other band members.\n\nThe band's part would both set a record for the highest number of musicians performing on a single and earn the marching musicians a platinum disc. Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood presented it to the Trojan band on October 4, 1980 during a game at Dodger Stadium, this time in front of a huge crowd.\n\nThe song is played at USC Trojan football games.\n\nThis song is also played at Arkansas Razorback football games because of their current mascot named Tusk.\n\nOften used as bumper music by late night radio talk show host Art Bell when he hosted Coast to Coast AM in the 1990s.\n\nA section of the track is played at the start of each show on The Mighty Boosh Live 2008 tour. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Tusk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
