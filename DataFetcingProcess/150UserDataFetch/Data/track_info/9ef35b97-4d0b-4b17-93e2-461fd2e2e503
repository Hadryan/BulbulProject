And I was walking down the steps of this building, it was probably four o’clock in the afternoon, and I come to a door — it’s apartment 3d or something — and there's a sign on it that says \"Daysleeper,\" and I walked a lot more carefully, quietly down the steps, thinking about that poor person who's trying to sleep, and me and my big old boots interrupting her sleep. So I wrote this song about a daysleeper that's working an 11-7 shift and how furious the balance is between the life that you live and the work that you have to do in order to support the life that you live.\"\n\nThe video, shot at Broadway Studios in the Astoria district of New York City in September 1998, was filmed in stop-frame photography to get what Stipe called a \"really druggy, really great look.\"] It features Stipe as the office worker who goes to work at night. All three band members then wear pajamas and bed socks, while failing to get to sleep during the day. The video was directed by the Icelandic Snorri brothers. \"I think it's about the sort of alien nature of a night shift,\" explained Mike Mills. \"The weird lighting, the fluorescent lights that you find and the isolation of working the graveyard shift - how it screws up your sleep patterns and that sort of thing, and I think that's the main image we're trying to get across.\"\n\nThe song \"The Lifting\" from R.E.M.'s 2001 album Reveal is a prequel to \"Daysleeper\" and features the same character.\n\nAccording to the Daysleeper Songfacts, the lyrics document the nocturnal trials of an international share trader on the verge of a breakdown.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/Daysleeper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
