It appears on their 1983 album Power, Corruption & Lies. It is featured in the teaser trailer of the 2006 film Marie Antoinette, and in an affecting karaoke version in the climactic scene of the 2009 film Modern Love is Automatic.

It returned to live performances in 2011, following a 22 year absence from setlists, having last been played live in 1989.\n\n\n\nReleased\t2 May 1983\nRecorded\tMarch 1982, Britannia Row, Islington\nGenre\tAlternative rock, jangle pop, post-punk\nLength\t5:15\nLabel\tFactory\nWriter\tBernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, Gillian Gilbert\nProducer\tNew Order <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order/_/Age+of+Consent\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
