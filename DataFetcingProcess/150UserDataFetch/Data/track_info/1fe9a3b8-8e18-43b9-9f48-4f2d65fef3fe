The Branch Davidians are a controversial Protestant sect. In 1993, a siege began when the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, accompanied by several members of the media, attempted to execute a search warrant at the Branch Davidian ranch at Mount Carmel, a property located 9 miles (14 km) east-northeast of Waco, Texas. 76 people (24 of them British nationals) died in the fire, including more than 20 children, two pregnant women, and the sect leader David Koresh. During the siege the deprogrammer Rick Ross said:\n\n    \"Koresh is your stock cult leader. ... They're all the same. Meet one and you've met them all. They're deeply disturbed, have a borderline personality disorder and lack any type of conscience. ... No one willingly enters into a relationship like this. ... So you're talking about deception and manipulation (by the leader), people being coached in ever so slight increments, pulled in deeper and deeper without knowing where it's going or seeing the total picture.\"\n\nThe standoff with the government decimated Koresh's group, giving Amo the opportunity to move onto the Mt. Carmel grounds. In November 1994, she had an armed standoff with a group that included future militia figure Ron Cole. Amo Roden also drew attention in 2001, when she drove to the Oklahoma City bombing memorial site in her pickup truck with Branch Davidian slogans, creating a brief bomb scare.\nBoards of Canada have made many references to this, most notably with the track ''Amo Bishop Roden''. When questioned about their aims in making such references, BoC express themselves in neutral terms (\"We're not religious at all [...] and if we're spiritual at all it's purely in the sense of caring about art and inspiring people with ideas.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/_/1969\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
