The song re-entered the UK charts at #55 over 30 years later, largely because of its use in the original British television series Life on Mars. \nIn 1968, Bowie wrote \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", a song with lyrics by Bowie set to the music of a 1967 French song (\"Comme d'habitude\"). Bowie's song was never released, but Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version, and rewrote it into \"My Way,\" made famous by Frank Sinatra in a 1969 recording on his album of the same name. The success of the Anka version prompted Bowie to write \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording.\nBBC Radio has described \"Life on Mars?\" as having \"one of the strangest lyrics ever\" consisting of a \"slew of surreal images\" like a Salvador Dalí painting. The line \"Look at those cavemen go\" is a reference to the song \"Alley Oop\", a one-off hit in 1960 for American doo-wop band The Hollywood Argyles.\nBowie, at the time of Hunky Dory's release in 1971, summed up the song as \"A sensitive young girl's reaction to the media\". In 1997 he added \"I think she finds herself disappointed with reality... that although she's living in the doldrums of reality, she's being told that there's a far greater life somewhere, and she's bitterly disappointed that she doesn't have access to it\".\nThe liner notes for Hunky Dory indicate that the song was 'inspired by Frankie'. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Life+on+Mars%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
