But in 2000 I was on a massive bender and one night I was drinking in the bar of the Glasgow School Of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn (Snow Patrol's drummer) found me in the stairwell with blood coming out of my head. He said I looked like a police chalk line and he thought I was dead.\n\nI was very lucky. A fall like that could easily finish you off. I split my head open and my eye was closed and I lost a few teeth. I was put on a plane to see my mum and dad and they were terrified when they saw me. I wrote Run soon after...The words 'Light up, light up' gave this sense of a beacon. There had to be a light at the end of a tunnel.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Snow+Patrol/_/Run\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
