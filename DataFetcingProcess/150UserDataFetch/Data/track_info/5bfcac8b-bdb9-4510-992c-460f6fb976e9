It was on their album Pieces of Eight. It reached #16 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is a first-person narrative of an outlaw, captured for a bounty, who recognizes that he is about to be executed for his criminal activities. The execution will be by hanging, as the outlaw laments, \"Hangman is coming down from the gallows and I don't have very long.\" Some pressings of the single were made with translucent, red vinyl. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Styx/_/Renegade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Renegade\" is a 1979 hit song recorded by the American rock band Styx.

The execution will be by hanging, as the outlaw laments, \"Hangman is coming down from the gallows and I don't have very long.\" Some pressings of the single were made with translucent, red vinyl.\n\nWhen performed live from 1978 to 1983, drummer John Panozzo increased the tempo of the drum pattern during the guitar solo sections. Also, the track would serve as the drum solo spot for Panozzo during that time frame save the Paradise Theater tour of 1981/82.\n\nAlthough songwriter Tommy Shaw and fellow Styx guitarist James Young usually played lead guitar on their own compositions, Young asked Shaw if he could take the solo on \"Renegade\". Shaw agreed, and later Young returned the favor by allowing Shaw to play lead on J.Y.'s \"Half-Penny, Two-Penny\" on the Paradise Theatre album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Styx/_/Renegade\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
