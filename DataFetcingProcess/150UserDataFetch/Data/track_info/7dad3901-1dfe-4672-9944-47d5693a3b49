It was recorded with Springsteen supplying almost all of the instrumentation, with bass and background vocals from \"Other Band\" member Tommy Simms. Additional saxophone and vocal parts by Ornette Coleman and \"Little\" Jimmy Scott, respectively, were recorded but never used.\n\nReleased in early 1994 as the main single from the film's original soundtrack, it became a huge success for Springsteen all over Europe and North America.\n\nThe song would achieve greater popularity in Europe than it would in the United States. While it peaked at #9 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it would become a number-one single in Germany and France. It would also peak at #2 in the United Kingdom, becoming Springsteen's highest charting hit in that country. It also peaked at #4 in Australia. \"Streets of Philadelphia\" ranks as his most recent top ten hit.\n\nThe song was also included in the album All Time Greatest Movie Songs, released by Sony in 1999. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Streets+of+Philadelphia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
