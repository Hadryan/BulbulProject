It reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart and #7 on the United States Charts. Like their previous hit \"You Really Got Me\", the song relies on a simple sliding power chord riff, although this song's riff is slightly more complicated, incorporating a B Flat after the chords F and G. Otherwise, the recordings are similar in beat and structure, with similar background vocals, progressions, and guitar solos. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks/_/All+Day+and+All+of+the+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"All Day and All of the Night\" is a song by the British band The Kinks from 1964.
