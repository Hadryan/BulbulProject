The track also appears on the soundtrack of American Teen. \"Great DJ\" is also the trailer music for 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire and was used in commercials for Year One.This song was also used in commercials for Indonesian mineral water Mizone\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ting+Tings/_/Great+DJ\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
