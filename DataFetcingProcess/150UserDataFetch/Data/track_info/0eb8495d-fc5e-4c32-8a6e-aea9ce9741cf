The song also reached #1 on the world-wide chart. The single is noted for its music video which stars Kelly Preston.\n\nThe song was inspired by the complicated relation between Maroon 5's vocalist, Adam Levine, and his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The song is one of the band's more melodic-sounding songs, with its instantly-recognisable bassline running parallel to the main textured guitar riff. In some versions of the song, including the UK release, the age of the girl in the lyrics is seventeen instead of eighteen.\n\nWhen the band was commissioned to perform at the AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony for George Lucas, this song was chosen in tribute to Lucas' children, mainly his oldest daughter. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/_/She+Will+Be+Loved\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
