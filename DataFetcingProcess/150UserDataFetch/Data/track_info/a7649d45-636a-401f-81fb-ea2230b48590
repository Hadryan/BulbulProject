The album was released with the intention of toning down the image of Madonna, who was being heavily criticized at the time. The singer decided to work with producer David Foster, who co-wrote and produced three songs with Madonna in September 1995. \"You'll See\" was released on October 30, 1995, by Maverick Records as the lead single from the album. An acoustic pop ballad, \"You'll See\" features instrumentation from percussion, tremolo guitar and piano, while lyrically it speaks of independence after end of a love affair. The song received positive reception from contemporary critics, with reviewers praising Madonna's vocals. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997.\n\n\"You'll See\" was commercially successful, reaching the top five in Austria, Canada, Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom. The single also managed to peak at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 making it Madonna's 29th top-ten single on the chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Michael Haussman, whose story line was a sequel to Madonna's previous music video for \"Take a Bow\". An alternate Spanish version, written by Argentine singer-songwriter Paz Martinez, also received a music video, and was included on the Latin American edition of Something to Remember. Madonna has performed the song live on the British television program Top of the Pops and on selected US shows of her 2001 Drowned World Tour. On 2009, Scottish singer Susan Boyle included a cover of the song on her debut studio album I Dreamed a Dream. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Madonna/_/You%27ll+See\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
