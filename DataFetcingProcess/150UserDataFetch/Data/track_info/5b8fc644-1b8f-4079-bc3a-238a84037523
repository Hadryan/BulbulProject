The song contains some lyrics from the first verse of \"Sober\", with the same basic melody, although the melody is considerably faster and has an instrumental chorus.\n\nThe song was recorded by Keenan with Tool for the first time in mid-1991 on an untitled demo tape referred to as 72826.\n\nVideo\nA video for \"Sober\" was made in 1993. It was filmed using stop-motion animation, with characters' models designed by Adam Jones and directed by Fred Stuhr. It was the first of Tool's videos to be made in stop motion, the earlier promo video for \"Hush\" being live action and featuring all four band members. However, brief flashes of the musicians can be seen near the beginning, as well as a live-action figure twitching and vibrating violently (Ã  la the film Jacob's Ladder).\n\nBesides being one of their first videos, it is also one of Tool's most ambiguous. Its protagonist is a small, humanoid being, who lives and sleeps in a rusty room sparsely decorated with a bed, table and chair. He happens upon a wooden box, which he opens near the beginning. Its contents are kept hidden for the majority of the video's duration, but it seems whatever it is has had adverse effects - there are repeated shots of the humanoid levitating in his chair, and his head and arm vibrating wildly. While experiencing these effects, he ventures through his living quarters and its many corridors.\n\nThe climax provides a barrage of imagery and revelations: a figure attached to a wall behind a translucent screen, a sentry of sorts wielding a mobile, robotic cannon and a worm like, organic creature hidden within the house's pipes. At the end, the box is empty, leaving the viewer to determine its meaning.\n\nNotable performances and covers\n    * In August 2006 Kirk Hammett, lead guitarist of Metallica, joined Tool on stage while performing and 'jammed' together with the band at a show in South Korea.\n    * In January 2007, at the Big Day Out music festival in Auckland, New Zealand, System of a Down frontman Serj Tankian joined Tool for an improvisational version of the song.\n    * Staind has released an acoustic cover version of \"Sober\" on their 2006 compilation The Singles: 1996-2006.\n    * String Quartet Tribute did a \"classical\" cover of the song for the album \"String Quartet to Tool.\" (They also have done albums covering other bands).\n\nReferences in popular culture\n    * In an episode of Beavis & Butt-Head, the eponymous duo provide commentary on the video. They mock the band's name, but give an otherwise positive review of the video.\n    * Electronic duo Orbital sampled the song in \"Tootled\", from their DVD album The Altogether. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/Sober\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
