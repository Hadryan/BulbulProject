However, during the sessions for The Bends it was rediscovered and remastered, as it was felt that it worked well with the rest of the album's content. The version that appears on the album is the original demo; it was never re-recorded.\n\nThe song is widely regarded as Radiohead's most accessible pop hit, and was a live favourite, though it has not been performed in a decade. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/High+and+Dry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
