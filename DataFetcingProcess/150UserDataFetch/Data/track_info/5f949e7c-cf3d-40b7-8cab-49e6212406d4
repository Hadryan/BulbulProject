The third one every 29 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable — they are not likely to come back into sync again.

Your experience of the piece, of course, is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements.

But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno/_/2%2F1\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
