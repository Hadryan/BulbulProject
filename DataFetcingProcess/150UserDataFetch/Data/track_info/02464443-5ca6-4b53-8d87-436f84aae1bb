It was the first single released from James Blunt's second studio album \"All the Lost Souls\". It is said that the song was inspired by the club scene on the island of Ibiza, where Blunt maintains a house and enjoys the social scene. Blunt stated in a radio interview with KISFM on 8 September 2007 that the girl from his lyrics \"Simona\" was indeed based on a real woman that he had met at a club. Blunt was not born until early 1974; he was therefore conceived in 1973.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/James+Blunt/_/1973\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"1973\" was written by Mark Batson and James Blunt.
