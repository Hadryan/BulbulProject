It is a throwback to the band's days as a hardcore punk band in the late 70's and on the song (as with most of its parent album \"Ill Communication\") the Beastie Boys play their own instruments (Adrock on guitar and lead vocals, MCA on bass and Mike D on drums). It is one the group's most well known songs thanks to its imaginative Spike Jonze-directed video which is an homage/parody to opening credits sequences to 1970s cop shows. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Beastie+Boys/_/Sabotage\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Sabotage\" is a  1994 single by the alternative hip-hop act Beastie Boys.
