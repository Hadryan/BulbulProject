It was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is one of U2's biggest hits to date. It was their fourth #1 single in the UK and was #1 for a week in Australia. The song peaked at #21 in the US, the band's highest position since \"Discotheque\" in 1997. The song won three Grammy Awards in 2001.\n\nAccording to Bono, \"Beautiful Day\" is about \"a man who has lost everything, but finds joy in what he still has.\"\n\nThe song is an optimistic anthem that opens with a drum machine and a rhythm sequencer. The verses are relatively quiet before The Edge's guitar and the song's signature riff join in for the choruses. The Edge recorded this song on his Gibson Les Paul Standard and plays the song live with his Gibson Explorer, which helps add the distinctive shimmering, chiming sound that made the band unique when they first debuted in the early 1980s.\n\nIn an episode of the Sundance Channel's Iconoclast, R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe said \"I love that song. I wish I'd written it, and they know I wish I'd written it. It makes me dance, It makes me angry that I didn't write it.\" Beautiful Day also opens ITV's football show \"The Championship\", and previously ITV's \"Premiership\" referring to soccer making a beautiful day.\n\nBeautiful Day is the most known track on the All That You Can't Leave Behind album, and has been regarded as one of U2's most famous songs. The song hit No.1 on charts in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland and also boosted sales of All That You Can't Leave Behind. Beautiful Day is included on The Best of 1990-2000 and U218 Singles.\n\nThe song won three Grammys in 2001: \"Record of the Year\", \"Song of the Year\", and \"Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal\".\n\nThe song \"Beautiful Day\", which debuted on the Elevation tour, is one of only four U2 songs to have been played at every concert since their introduction (the other three being \"One\", \"Vertigo\", and \"City of Blinding Lights\").\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Beautiful+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
