The band had rehearsed the song for a two-part tribute album (Tribute to Accept vol. 1 & 2) in 1999 but didn't have any extra time to record it. So, they decided to include the song on A Virgin and a Whore.\n\nThe album cover art was made by Niklas Sundin of Cabin Fever Media and guitarist of Dark Tranquillity. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eternal+Tears+of+Sorrow/A+Virgin+and+a+Whore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
