The album featured the band at its most easily accessible, and the single \"Cut Your Hair\" was the band's closest brush with mainstream success. As of 2007, the album has sold almost 500,000 copies and was a UK Top 20 hit upon release. Although it was not so successful in the US charts, it has since been critically acclaimed across the US music press as a classic alternative rock album. The album was reissued on October 26, 2004 by Matador Records under the name Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pavement/Crooked+Rain,+Crooked+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
