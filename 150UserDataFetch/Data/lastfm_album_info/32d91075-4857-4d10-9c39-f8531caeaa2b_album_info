It was produced by Nick Launay, who produced Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds three previous studio albums—Nocturama (2003), Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus (2004) and Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! (2008)— and Grinderman's two studio albums. Segments of the album's recording sessions were featured in the official trailer for Push the Sky Away, which was posted on YouTube upon the album's announcement. The band entered the studio when Nick Cave had \"unformed and pupal\" ideas, and the band \"[transformed] them into things of wonder.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Cave+&+The+Bad+Seeds/Push+the+Sky+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
