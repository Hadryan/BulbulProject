It was released on 7 July 1970 through Elektra Records. Though initially commercially unsuccessful, Fun House developed a strong cult following and, like its successor (1973's Raw Power), is generally considered integral in the development of punk rock.\n\nEven though Elektra Records' Jac Holzman believed that the MC5 had more potential than The Stooges, he made a crucial intervention that former Kingsmen keyboardist Don Galluci produce the album. Having seen the group live, Galluci said to Holzman that it was an \"Interesting group, but I don't think you can get this feeling on tape\". Holzman said it didn't matter anyway because he had already reserved recording time in L.A. The album was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California from 11 May to 25 May 1970.Galluci's plan as a producer was to record a about a dozen takes of each song every day and pick which one that would appear on the album. The first day consisted of sound checking and run-throughs of the songs prepared. The entire band used headphones with the bass and drums isolated by baffles while Iggy Pop sang his vocals through a condensor microphone on a boom.The result was terrible in the band's opinion. They took exception to the atmosphere inside the studio with sound proof paddings and isolators. To achieve the vision that The Stooges and Galluci had, they stripped the entire studio of its attire to take the next step into a pseudo-live feel. According to Galluci, they set up the band in the way they normally play at a concert. For example, Iggy was singing through a hand-held microphone, and the guitar and bass amps were placed side by side. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stooges/Fun+House\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
