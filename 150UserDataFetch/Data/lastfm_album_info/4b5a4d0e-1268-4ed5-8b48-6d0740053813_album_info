It was recorded in late 1991 at BearTracks Studios in New York City. The album is the first album to feature James LaBrie on vocals. The album maintains its position as the band's most commercially successful album to date[citation needed], and the song Pull Me Under's status as the only Top 10 hit the band has ever had. This song has also had some very recent success as it has appeared in the video game Guitar Hero: World Tour. Many critics and fans cite this album as a landmark release for the progressive metal genre.\n\n\nHistory\nAfter Charlie Dominici's departure from the band, they auditioned nearly 200 people across the nation before James LaBrie sent the band an audition tape. LaBrie was formerly in the Canadian glam metal band Winter Rose, but saw potential in the band, and thus decided to audition. After a short jam session, the band chose him as their lead singer, and he has been the band's lead singer ever since.\n\nWith LaBrie on board, the band was signed to a seven album contract by Atco Records, and shortly after began recording their new album. The lead single, Pull Me Under gained the band considerable commercial success with its airplay on MTV and radio, garnering them a Top 10 hit on radio charts. When the album was released, it sold at a steady pace, only helped by their relentless touring across the world. Images and Words would go on to be the band's most commercially successful album, and often is considered a landmark release in the progressive metal genre by many newer bands in the genre such as Tool.\n\nImages and Words was played in its entirety, on several occasions, during the European leg of the \"Chaos in Motion\" tour, in celebration of its 15th anniversary.\n\nReception\nImages and Words has garnered overwhelmingly positive critical and fan acclaim. As of July 5, 2008, heavy metal database The Metal Archives ranks Images and Words as Dream Theater's second best album with a 92% rating based on 11 fan reviews[2]. Murat Batmaz of the popular progressive rock/metal review website Sea of Tranquility awarded the record a perfect score, calling it a \"masterpiece\" and \"the most important Dream Theater album, ever\".\n\nImages and Words is currently ranked #2 on Digital Dream Door's list of the top 100 progressive metal albums of all time .\n\n\n\n1. \"Pull Me Under\"   Kevin Moore Dream Theater 8:15 \n2. \"Another Day\"   John Petrucci Dream Theater 4:24 \n3. \"Take the Time\"   Dream Theater Dream Theater 8:21 \n4. \"Surrounded\"   Moore Dream Theater 5:30 \n5. \"Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\"   Petrucci Dream Theater 9:32 \n6. \"Under a Glass Moon\"   Petrucci Dream Theater 7:04 \n7. \"Wait for Sleep\"   Moore Moore 2:32 \n8. \"Learning to Live\"   John Myung Dream Theater 11:31 \n\n\nBand\nJames LaBrie – Vocals \nKevin Moore – Keyboards \nJohn Myung – Bass guitar \nJohn Petrucci – Guitar \nMike Portnoy – Drums and percussion \n\nGuest\nJay Beckenstein – Soprano saxophone on \"Another Day\" \nRIAA Certifications\nThese statistics were compiled from the RIAA certification online database.[5]\n\nGold - February 2, 1995 \nChart Performance\nSingles\n\nYear Single Mainstream Rock Tracks \n1992 \"Pull Me Under\" #10 \n1992 \"Another Day\" #29 \n1992 \"Take the Time\" #22 \n\nBillboard 200:\n\nImages and Words - #61 \nTop Heatseekers:\n\nImages and Words - #2 \nGreatest Guitar Solos of All Time:\n\n\"Under a Glass Moon\" - #98 \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/Images+and+Words\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
