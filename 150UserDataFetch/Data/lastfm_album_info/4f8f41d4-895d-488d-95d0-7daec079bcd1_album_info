The organ parts were recorded using the organ at St. George's church in Brede, East Sussex. The album charted at #49 on the UK album charts. The album was mixed at The Chairworks recording complex in Yorkshire. The Bachelor was originally part of a double album entitled Battle, named for the Sussex town where he recorded the new material. On 19 February 2009, Wolf announced that Battle had been split into two releases, The Bachelor and The Conqueror. The Bachelor would be released 1 June 2009 and The Conqueror would see release in 2010. Speaking of the decision to split the release into two albums rather than the double album, Wolf expressed the desire \"not to overload people with too much\". He has since suggested that while The Bachelor was practically finished, he felt that there were still \"a couple of songs or stories to be written for the second part\".\n\nA preview of the album as well as 2 tracks presumed to be appearing on The Conqueror were released on the Bandstocks website, and later featured on Wolf's MySpace page, entitled \"Battle Megamix\".\n\nGuest musicians on The Bachelor include Atari Teenage Riot's Alec Empire (Vulture, Battle), actress Tilda Swinton (Oblivion, Thickets, Theseus), folk musician Eliza Carthy (The Bachelor) and avant-garde electronic pioneer Matthew Herbert (Who Will?). \n\nThe first single from the album is \"Vulture\", which was released on 20 April 2009, with \"Hard Times\" as the second single, released in July. The third single, Damaris, was released on 14 December 2009.\n\nThe album artwork features Patrick in a similar position to his first album, Lycanthropy, and also features a similar font placement. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Wolf/The+Bachelor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
