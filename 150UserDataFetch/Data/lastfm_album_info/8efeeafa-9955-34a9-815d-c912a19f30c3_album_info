The album's opening number, \"In the Evening,\" with its stomping rhythms and heavy, staggered riffs, suggests that Zeppelin haven't deviated from their course, but by the time the rolling shuffle of \"South Bound Suarez\" kicks into gear, it's apparent that they've regained their sense of humor. After \"South Bound Suarez,\" the group tries a variety of styles, whether it's an overdriven homage to Bakersfield county called \"Hot Dog,\" the layered, Latin-tinged percussion and pianos of \"Fool in the Rain,\" or the slickly seductive ballad \"All My Love.\" \"Carouselambra,\" a lurching, self-consciously ambitious synth-driven number, and the slow blues \"I'm Gonna Crawl\" aren't quite as impressive as the rest of the album, but the record was a graceful way to close to Zeppelin's career, even if it wasn't intended as the final chapter. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/In+Through+the+Out+Door\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
