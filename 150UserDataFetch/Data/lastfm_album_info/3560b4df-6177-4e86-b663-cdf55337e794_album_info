The album was recorded in June and July 2007 at The State of the Ark Studios in Richmond, London and mixed by Nick Launay at British Grove Studios in Chiswick, and was released on 3 March 2008.\n\nIt would also be the last album to feature founding member Mick Harvey, who left the Bad Seeds in 2009, and the second without founding member Blixa Bargeld. Dig features the same personnel as the Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus double album. It is also the first to be released since the Bad Seeds side project Grinderman released their eponymous album. In several interviews Cave has stated that this album would \"sound like Grinderman\", implying a garage rock sound. In line with this rough-and-ready approach, the album was recorded in about five days, an uncommonly short period for a full-length album.\n\nDig, Lazarus, Dig!!! features artwork by British artists Tim Noble and Sue Webster.\n\nPersonnel:\nNick Cave – Vocals (1-11), Organ (1,2,6,7), Piano (3,8,9), Tambourine (3,5,11), Sleigh Bells (3,11), Toms (5), Harmonica (5), Electric Guitar (9), Vibra-Slap (11)\nMartyn P.

Traumatised, actually. We are all, of course, in awe of the greatest of Christ's miracles—raising a man from the dead—but I couldn't help but wonder how Lazarus felt about it. As a child it gave me the creeps, to be honest. I've taken Lazarus and stuck him in New York City, in order to give the song, a hip, contemporary feel. I was also thinking about Harry Houdini who spent a lot of his life trying to debunk the spiritualists who were cashing in on the bereaved. He believed there was nothing going on beyond the grave. He was the second greatest escapologist, Harry was, Lazarus, of course, being the greatest. I wanted to create a kind of vehicle, a medium, for Houdini to speak to us if he so desires, you know, from beyond the grave.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Cave+&+The+Bad+Seeds/Dig,+Lazarus,+Dig%21%21%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
