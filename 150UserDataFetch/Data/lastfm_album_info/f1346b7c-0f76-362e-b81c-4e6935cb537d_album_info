Instead, they re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's studio in Virginia. The final album was released in October of 2002 under the title One by One. Singles from the album included \"All My Life\", \" Times Like These\", \"Low\", and \"Have It All\". The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2005, \"Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
