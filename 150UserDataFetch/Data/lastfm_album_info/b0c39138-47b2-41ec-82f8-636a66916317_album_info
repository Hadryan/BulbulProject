The album signifies a change to a simpler, and more straightforward musical style for the band.\n\nLead singer Gavin Hayes comments on his lyrical approach to this album, saying, \"The whole underlying basis of the lyrics and the music is opposites, contrasts... I’d written some lyrics that are based around conversations or arguments, so we thought about a record with two halves that contrast each other. The whole basis of the record could be about objection to ideas, and contrast.\"\n\nThe album was released with a booklet containing art created by dredg bassist, Drew Roulette and lead singer, Gavin Hayes. Initially there was an original painting created for each song and two others, a total of 14 paintings, in the Catch Without Arms Collection, which are available for purchase through the band's website. These paintings, while abstract in nature, all contain elements directly and indirectly related to the song they portray. The artwork not only was an accompaniment to the album, but also the map to a treasure. Over several weeks, various clues were posted on the official dredg website that were meant to point users to a buried treasure of sorts. Once the treasure was found, another hunt began for the three people who found the original treasure.\n\nCatch Without Arms was produced by Terry Date, who had produced multiple Soundgarden, Pantera, Deftones, and Limp Bizkit albums. Former Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo worked with the band on production and arrangement of the album. DeGarmo also shares writing credits on two tracks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/dredg/Catch+Without+Arms\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
