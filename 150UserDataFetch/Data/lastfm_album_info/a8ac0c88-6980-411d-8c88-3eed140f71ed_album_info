The album features a wide range of samples and instrumentation, with many aspects of alternative hip hop that would come to dominate the hip hop music scene in the mid-late 1990s. The Score's production was handled mostly by the Fugees themselves and Jerry Duplessis, with additional production from Salaam Remi, John Forté, Shawn King, and Diamond D. The album's guest raps are from Outsidaz' members Rah Digga, Young Zee  and Pacewon, as well as Omega, John Forté, and Diamond D. Most CD and import versions of the album feature four bonus tracks, including three remixes of \"Fu-Gee-La\", and a short acoustic Wyclef Jean solo track entitled \"Mista Mista.\"\n\nUpon its release, The Score was a commercial success, peaking at the number one spot on both the Billboard 200, and the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The singles \"Killing Me Softly,\" \"Fu-Gee-La,\" and \"Ready or Not\" also achieved notable chart success, and helped the group achieve worldwide recognition. On October 3, 1997, The Score was certified 6X's platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In addition to receiving mostly favorable reviews upon its release, the album has garnished a considerable amount of acclaim over the years, with many music critics and publications noting it as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time, and also one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. In 1998, the album was included in The Source's 100 best rap albums list, and in 2003, it was ranked number 477 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fugees/The+Score\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
