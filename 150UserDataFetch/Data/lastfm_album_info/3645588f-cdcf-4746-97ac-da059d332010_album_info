The album was the final album recorded featuring Lou Reed, though he had departed from the band shortly before the album's release. In 2003, Loaded was #109 on Rolling Stone's reissue of their 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nLoaded was a commercial effort aimed at radio play, another step away from the Warhol-influenced days. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album \"loaded with hits\". Doug Yule said, \"On Loaded there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like this is sort of a Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground/Loaded\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
