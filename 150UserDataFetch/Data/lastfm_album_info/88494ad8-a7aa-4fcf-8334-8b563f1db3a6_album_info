The digital download version was released on November 30. The song \"Tree by the River\" has also been released, for free download, on Iron & Wine's website. On January 5, Iron & Wine performed all but one song from Kiss Each Other Clean live at the Greene Space in New York City for a live broadcast on NPR's website. The album marks a further change in style – in an interview with SPIN magazine, Beam said “It’s more of a focused pop record. It sounds like the music people heard in their parent’s car growing up… that early-to-mid-’70s FM, radio-friendly music.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Sam Beam.\n1.  \"Walking Far from Home\" – 4:47\n2.  \"Me and Lazarus\" – 3:03\n3.  \"Tree by the River\" – 3:58\n4.  \"Monkeys Uptown\" – 3:48\n5.  \"Half Moon\" – 3:16\n6. \"Rabbit Will Run\" – 5:30\n7. \"Godless Brother in Love\" – 3:50\n8.  \"Big Burned Hand\" – 4:12\n9. \"Glad Man Singing\" – 4:40\n10.  \"Your Fake Name Is Good Enough for Me\" – 7:01\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Iron+&+Wine/Kiss+Each+Other+Clean\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
