It was an acid experience, basically. It's drug music.\" -Wolfgang Voigt <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gas/Pop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"I had an image in my mind of a gaseous and nebulous sound, of an exhilarating streaming music which literally flows over, which has no beginning or end, no hard edges, only softness.
