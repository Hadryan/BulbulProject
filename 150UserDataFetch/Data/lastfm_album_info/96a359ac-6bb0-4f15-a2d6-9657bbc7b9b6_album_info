Following a tumultuous recording period, which included the departure of long-time drummer Joey Castillo, founding member Josh Homme described the album as \"documenting the journey of moving forward, you know. It was a tough time and I thought, 'I can run away from this, or I can run into it.'\"\nThe album received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, reaching number two on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the Billboard 200, making it Queens of the Stone Age's highest U.S. chart position to date and their first album to top the charts in the United States. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age/...Like+Clockwork\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
