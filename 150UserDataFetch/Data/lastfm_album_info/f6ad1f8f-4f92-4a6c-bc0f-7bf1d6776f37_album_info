The success of the White Rider suite (based on J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and appearing on the band's previous album, Mirage), inspired the group to write more novel-inspired conceptual suites. The band considered several novels on which to base their next album. For a time they settled on Siddhartha, by Hermann Hesse, and some songs were written before the idea was abandoned in favor of Paul Gallico's novel The Snow Goose. The album's name, originally simply \"The Snow Goose\", was altered to accommodate legal protests by Gallico.\n\nThe album reached silver status in 1981, and is considered by many to be their most accessible work. It is remarkable for having no lyrics and orchestral (plus rock) instrumentation.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs by Peter Bardens and Andrew Latimer.\n\n   1. \"The Great Marsh\" – 2:02\n   2. \"Rhayader\" – 3:01\n   3. \"Rhayader Goes to Town\" – 5:19\n   4. \"Sanctuary\" – 1:05\n   5. \"Fritha\" – 1:19\n   6. \"The Snow Goose\" – 3:11\n   7. \"Friendship\" – 1:43\n   8. \"Migration\" – 2:01\n   9. \"Rhayader Alone\" – 1:50\n  10. \"Flight of the Snow Goose\" – 2:40\n  11. \"Preparation\" – 3:58\n  12. \"Dunkirk\" – 5:19\n  13. \"Epitaph\" – 2:07\n  14. \"Fritha Alone\" – 1:40\n  15. \"La Princesse Perdue\" – 4:43\n  16. \"The Great Marsh\" – 1:20\n\nBonus tracks on the 2002 remaster:\n\n   1. \"Flight of The Snow Goose (Single Edit)\" 2:05\n   2. \"Rhayader (Single Edit)\" 3:09\n   3. \"Flight of the Snow Goose (Alternate Single Edit)\" 2:49\n   4. \"Rhayader Goes to Town\" (Recorded Live at The Marquee Club) 5:07\n   5. \"The Snow Goose / Freefall\" (Recorded Live at The Marquee Club) 11:01\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Andrew Latimer: Guitars, Flute\n    * Peter Bardens: Keyboards, Organ\n    * Doug Ferguson: Bass\n    * Andy Ward: Drums, Percussion\n\nRelease details\n\n    * 1975, UK, Decca Records 291 034, Release Date April 1975, LP\n    * 2002, UK, London 8829292, Release Date 3 June 2002, CD (remastered edition)\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Camel/The+Snow+Goose\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
