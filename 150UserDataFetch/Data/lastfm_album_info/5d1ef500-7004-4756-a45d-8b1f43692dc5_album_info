The record entered the UK Albums Chart at #1. It also debuted at #65 on the Billboard 200. It was certified Gold by the BPI on July 13, 2007.\n\nThe album won the Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 50th Grammy Awards, making The Chemical Brothers the only artist to win this award more than once.\n\nIn June 2006 it was announced on their official website that The Chemical Brothers were working on material for a new album, then-codenamed \"Chemical 6\". Ed Simons of the duo was also quoted as saying that they would hope to \"put a battle weapon out for the summer\", which was seen as a reference to their Electronic Battle Weapon series on white label.\n\n\"Electronic Battle Weapon 8\" and \"Electronic Battle Weapon 9\" debuted on Pete Tong's BBC Radio 1 show on December 8, 2006. The two tracks were later released as a double A-sided vinyl record prior to The Chemical Brothers' New Years Eve appearance at Turnmills in London. A version of \"Electronic Battle Weapon 8\" is featured on the We Are the Night album under the title \"Saturate\". At the same Turnmills appearance, the duo debuted a track at midnight to welcome the new year. This track was eventually released as \"Burst Generator\", found on the album.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers officially announced We Are the Night at their MySpace page on March 21, 2007. It suffered a delay in release due to an issue during production of the artwork. An online \"old-skool\" The Chemical Brothers computer game by EMI was subsequently released as an apology.\n\nOn April 12, 2007, Tong was again privileged to debut a track by The Chemical Brothers. The first single from the album, \"Do It Again\" aired on his Radio 1 \"In New Music We Trust\" show. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chemical+Brothers/We+Are+The+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
