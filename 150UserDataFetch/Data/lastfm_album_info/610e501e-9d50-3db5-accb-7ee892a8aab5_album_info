In Europe, the album sold six million copies, and in the USA, one million copies. Reviews for On Every Street upon its release were mixed. The album features American drummer Jeff Porcaro from Toto (the group's drummer Terry Williams had departed from the band two years previously).\n\nDire Straits promoted the album with a gruelling world tour which lasted until the end of 1992. After the group disbanded in 1995, Mark Knopfler pursued a solo career and released his debut album Golden Heart in 1996.\n\nIt was remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the U.S. and on September 19, 2000 in the United States. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/On+Every+Street\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
