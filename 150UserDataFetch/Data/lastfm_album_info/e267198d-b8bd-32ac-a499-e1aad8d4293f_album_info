electronic music group The Future Sound of London.\n\nThough almost without any lyrics to speak of, most of the first half of the album (with the exception of \"Her Face Forms In Summertime\") is dark and full of well structured malevolence in that its songs combine synthetic sounds with samples to create an apocalyptic, dystopian atmosphere, the second half of the disc is rather more relaxed however and FSOL combine the darkness with more of their now familiar complex, ambient techniques to create an odd, peaceful yet intriguing atmosphere.\n\nThe album art consisted of 3D graphics, photography, and writing complementing the album's themes, combined via digital image editing. This was created primarily by the band and then-frequent artistic collaborator Buggy G. Riphead. A limited edition release of the album included a 196-page book, containing additional artwork and writing in the same style.\n\nMy Kingdom and We Have Explosive were released as singles. The \"My Kingdom\" music video was directed by the same artistic collaboration, whereas the \"We Have Explosive\" music video was directed by 2D-animator Run Wrake. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Future+Sound+of+London/Dead+Cities\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
