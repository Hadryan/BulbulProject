While often considered a seminal work to come out of the New York punk scene of the late 1970's, the album differs from conventional punk in its clean, textured guitar-based arrangements and extended improvisation. As a result, it is also often cited as important to the development of post-punk and New Wave genres. While critically acclaimed at the time of its release, the album failed to garner commercial success. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Television/Marquee+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Marquee Moon\" is the debut album by American rock band Television, released in 1977.
