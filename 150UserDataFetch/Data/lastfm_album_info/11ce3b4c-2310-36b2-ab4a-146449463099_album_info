From Mark Knopfler's own words, this album was released because the defunct Dire Straits still owed an album to PolyGram (now Mercury). This album was a means to end the legal contract, before Mark Knopfler began his solo career (still signed to Mercury).\n\nThe first seven tracks were recorded for the BBC \"Live In Concert\" series on July 22nd 1978. Track 8, \"Tunnel Of Love\" was recorded for the BBC-TV program \"Old Grey Whistle Test\" on January 31st 1981.\n\nThis record features one unreleased song, a co-written track with brother David, \"What's The Matter Baby?\" It is the only co-written song in Dire Straits history. (There are two other Dire Straits songs on which Mark Knopfler shared writing credits -- \"Money for Nothing\" and \"Tunnel of Love\" - but in each case the song itself is entirely by Knopfler with only a small contribution to the backing or arrangement by the other credited artist.) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/Live+At+The+BBC\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
