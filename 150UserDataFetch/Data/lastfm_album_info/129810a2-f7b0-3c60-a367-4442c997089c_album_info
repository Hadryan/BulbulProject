With Public Strain the band honed a sound truthful to that reverb drenched noise while allowing the pop sensibilities to surface into clearer focus.\n\nFrom the opening strains of \"Can't You See\" it's clear that the album is far more than just a continuation of their debut. Resting upon a plodding bass line, deadpan vocal delivery, and bowed guitars and cello, this moody, nocturnal ballad opens the album on a dark note â€“ one that is quickly countered by \"Heat Distraction\", a jigsaw of bright guitar phrases and winding time signatures. This exact balance of delicate and dense is a pervasive thread throughout the album, reflecting the contradiction of the band's environment buried in urban sprawl framed by prairie landscape.\n\nWhether twisting through the urgent krautrock of \"Locust Valley\", an exercise of harmony through simplicity, or climaxing with the bittersweet melody of \"Eyesore\", the album somehow builds luminous contrast out of a palette of grays.\n\nIn places claustrophobic, conjuring walking dreams of sexual anguish and general decay, elsewhere soaring with vintage guitar tones and vocal melodies or collapsing into swirling, mesmerizing swells, Public Strain cycles through insomnia, paranoia, resignation and euphoria, to capture a band with an undeniable voice coming into full awareness of their craft.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Women/Public+Strain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
