The album became fully realized later in recording studios located in Europe. The cross-continental journey and combination of cultures helped to define and inspire the right blend of cold electronics with warm strings and keys, along with a dreamlike vocal that drifts in throughout.\n\nFor The Devil's Walk, Apparat enlisted the help of others to help fully realize the material. Joshua Eustis (of Telefon Tel Aviv) and friend Fredo Noguerira were brought in to contribute, yet at a certain point, the project hit a lull. The fire was rekindled later in Europe with the help of yet another contributor, Patrick \"Nackt\" Christensen., who re-inspired Apparat and helped craft the finished product. The influence of late, quiet nights in a simple tropical atmosphere can be heard, as can the exhilaration Apparat rediscovered after time away from these songs.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Apparat/The+Devil%27s+Walk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
