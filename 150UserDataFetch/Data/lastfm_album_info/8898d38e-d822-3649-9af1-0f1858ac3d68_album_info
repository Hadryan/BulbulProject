It was released on 9 October of 2001 through Music For Nations.\nThe album is a major stylistic departure from Anathema's previous releases. Alex Henderson, writing for AllMusic, described it as an album that has nothing to do with metal, instead sounding like the alternative rock band Radiohead and the classic rock bands Pink Floyd and Beatles.\nThe drummer John Douglas came up with half of the songs. He wrote Pressure, Looking Outside Inside, Panic, the title track and the hidden acoustic track at the end of \"Temporary Peace\" called \"In the Dog's House\".\n\n\"Pressure\" was originally set to be released as a single to promote \"A Fine Day to Exit\" but the song received no backing from major radio or television stations. A video was shot for it but was only ever played once on Tommy Vance's rock show on VH-1.\n\"Temporary Peace\" ends at roughly 6 minutes. The main song ends with the sound of waves crashing on a beach. However, after 2 minutes the band members start a monologue for 2 minutes, making it sound like a \"mad person\" is talking to himself. The sound of waves remain for 3 minutes of the track. Finally, in the remaining 3 minutes, a hidden song performed with acoustic guitars is played. This is separately titled \"In the Dog's House.\" As they finish singing, the audio track ends.\nThe band recorded an instrumental intro track, somewhat reminiscent of the song \"Violence\" from their later record A Natural Disaster. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Anathema/A+Fine+Day+to+Exit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
