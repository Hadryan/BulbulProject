Within these 11 songs, there's an unfashionable Romanticist preoccupation with horror and beauty that counters the disposability and clinical sheen of modern pop. \n‘Details Not Recorded,’ is a collection of love and shadows, on which Johnson finds inspiration in everything from Edgar Allan Poe and ETA Hoffman to Elizabethan madrigals and carnival waltz.  But there's also a nod to the bare-hearted narratives of 70’s Leonard Cohen and the intricate futuristic experimentation of such pioneers as Bjork and Johnson’s fond favourites, Disco Inferno. \n\nRecorded between his London home and SOUP studio, an analogue heaven beneath the Duke Of Uke ukelele shop in Spitalfields, ‘Details Not Recorded’ is an unashamedly lo-fi affair.  These songs have a intimate warmth, borne of first takes, of close mics, of static buzz, of creaking furniture, of parlour windows left open to the street. \n\nLyrically, Johnson has never shied away from the darker side of the human condition.  Opener, “Brilliant Ships” crackles with the industrial oppressiveness of David Lynch’s ‘Eraserhead’ whereas ‘My Horror Mask’ could’ve been written by, or for, The Elephant Man, Joseph Merrick.  Indeed, Johnson’s favourite characters are the unfortunates.  The lonely, the misunderstood, the lovelorn, the deceived, the underdog all find a compassionate home.  Johnson even includes himself within that cast on, ‘I Know You Know My Name,’ a wry swipe at those who’ve crossed the street to avoid him (and his music) these past years : “They'll render me to ash and say they loved me first. But now the house is cold and empty is the purse.”\n\nJohnson is accompanied on 'Details' by a small band of like-minded souls - Leaf Recordings' artists (Keiron)Phelan/(David)Sheppard provide flute and drums, bass, additional guitar respectively.  Willard Grant Conspiracy bowman, Josh Hillard, injects viola and violin, whilst Angele David-Guillou counterpoints with backing vocals and Jerome Tcherneyan of Piano Magic supplements percussion.  Johnson, himself, presides over the vocal, MIDI guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, programming, keyboards, percussion, melodica, recorder, whistling and bells.\n\nGlen Johnson founded his group. Piano Magic, as far back as 1996.  Since then, they’ve released 12 long players and multiple singles and EPs on a plethora of independent labels, from 4AD to Morr Music to Important Records.  For the past 6 years, the band has been made up of both English and French members, though their music has the unmistakable air of classic late 70’s/early 80’s coldwave. Johnson has also recorded under the guise of Textile Ranch and Future Conditional.  \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Glen+Johnson/Details+Not+Recorded\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
