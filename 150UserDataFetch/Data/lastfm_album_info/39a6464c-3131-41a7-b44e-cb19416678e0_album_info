It was released on May 31, 1994 by Grand Royal Records. Co-produced by Beastie Boys and Mario C., the album is among the band's most varied releases, drawing from hip-hop, punk rock, jazz and funk. Ill Communication features musical contributions from Money Mark, Eric Bobo and Amery \"AWOL\" Smith and vocal contributions from Q-Tip and Biz Markie. The Beastie Boys were influenced by Miles Davis' jazz rock albums Agharta and On the Corner while recording Ill Communication.\n\nMike D and Adam Yauch collaborated with Gibran Evans of T.A.Z. to create the album packaging, and to choose the unique cover photo taken by Bruce Davidson. The hand-drawn typeface was created by designer Jim Evans specifically for Ill Communication, and was used throughout the promotion of the album. The album booklet also features the artwork \"Gaia\" by Alex Grey.\n\nIll Communication became the band's second number-one album on the US Billboard 200 albums chart and their second triple platinum album. The album was supported by the single \"Sabotage\", which was accompanied by a music video directed by Spike Jonze that parodied 1970s cop shows.\n\nSingles\n\nThe album's first single Sabotage was released on January 28, 1994. The album's second single Get It Together was released on March 17, 1994. The album's third single Sure Shot was released on May 31, 1994 and features a sample from jazz flautist Jeremy Steig's Howlin' For Judy, thereby providing the main instrumental part of the song. The album's fourth single Root Down was released in 1995. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nCritical reception\n\nRolling Stone included Ill Communication in their \"Essential Recordings of the 90's\".
