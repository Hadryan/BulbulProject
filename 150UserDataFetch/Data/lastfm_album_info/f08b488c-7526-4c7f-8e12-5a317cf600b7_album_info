The first single in the UK was \"Alice\", and in the EU was \"Disco Lies\" and the second single will be \"I Love to Move in Here\"  followed possibly by \"Ooh Yeah\", as is hinted on Moby's official website through a video competition.\n\nThe album was recorded in Moby's home studio in Manhattan, New York and features a number of guest vocalists, including Wendy Starland, MC Grandmaster Caz, one of the writers of \"Rapper's Delight\" (on \"I Love to Move in Here\"), Sylvia from the band Kudu, British MC Aynzli and the Nigerian 419 Squad.\n\nOn his official website, Moby stated that this album is \"a lot more dance-oriented and electronic than my last few albums, probably as a result of all of the DJ'ing I've been doing lately\", and he also wrote that:\n\n\"Last Night is basically a love letter to dance music in New York City. What I love about the New York approach to dance music is the eclecticism and the open minded-ness on the part of the musicians, the DJ's, and the people in the bars and clubs. In making Last Night, I essentially tried to take a long 8 hour night out in New York City and condense it into a 65 minute long album.\"\n\nIn December 2007, an album sampler on mp3 was released as well as the album cover named last-night-promo_01.jpg.\n\nThe album leaked on the internet a few days before its official release date. It is currently streaming in full on Moby's Myspace page. It can also be streamed on imeem here.\n\nMoby recently mentioned in a journal entry on his website that the track \"Disco Lies\" from Last Night appears in the new film Cloverfield. The song is played at Rob's farewell party and on the Cloverfield Mix. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Moby/Last+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
