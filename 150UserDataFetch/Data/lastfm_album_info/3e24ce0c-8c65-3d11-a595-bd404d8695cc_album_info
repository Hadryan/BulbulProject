The album's second track, \"Cody\" is much more like a traditional pop song than most of the band's repertoire. Still slow and meandering, it features an uncharacteristically distinct melody, slide guitar and relatively prominent vocals. Much of Come on Die Young consists of slow, quiet, drum-driven tracks containing tense, feedback-laden crescendos and occasionally ambient textures. Near the end of the album, the bombastic \"Christmas Steps\" breaks away from this quiet tension and displays a return to Mogwai's more well-known distortion-heavy dynamics.\n\nIt received a somewhat muted reception when compared to Mogwai Young Team. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for Allmusic, wrote:\n\nâ€œ Perhaps Come on Die Young wouldn't have seemed as disappointing if it hadn't arrived on the wave of hype and expectation, but the truth is, it pales in comparison to their own work. \"\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mogwai/Come+On+Die+Young\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
