Each song is so densely layered, the three-hundredth listen sounds as fresh as the first. Singer Kele Okereke’s voice jumps left and right, speaking and shouting in bursts between electronic lifts rising to a plateau of pretty-boy singing before guitar-god rock breaks things back down again. The skill this band employs could plant suspicions that they’re a popular, more experienced band, hiding their identities to release a completely different album than they could otherwise, but, in fact, these newcomers aren’t widely known superstars — yet.\n\nGrade: A\nREVIEW BY: MICHAEL DELGADO <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bloc+Party/Silent+Alarm\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
