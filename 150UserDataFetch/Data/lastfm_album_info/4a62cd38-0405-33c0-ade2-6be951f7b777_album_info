Many of the songs that didn't make it onto the album were featured in a B-sides compilation titled Bee Hives released in 2004. You Forgot It in People features intricate, experimental production techniques and a large number of instruments coinciding with the band's vastly expanded size.\n\nMusic videos were made for a number of tracks, including singles \"Stars and Sons\", \"Almost Crimes\", \"Pitter Patter Goes My Heart\", and \"Cause = Time\". The album also features \"Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl\" and \"Lover's Spit\", two songs that went on to become the band's biggest \"fan favorites.\"\n\nIn Chart's 2005 reader poll of the 50 greatest Canadian albums of all time, conducted just three years after the album's release, You Forgot It in People ranked fourth, behind only Sloan's Twice Removed, Neil Young's Harvest and Joni Mitchell's Blue. The album also placed 27th on Pitchfork Media's list of the 100 best albums from 2000 to 2004, and 28th in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums. Stylus Magazine placed it seventh on their Top 50 Albums: 2000-2005. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Social+Scene/You+Forgot+It+In+People\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
