Spears began working on this album as early as February 2006, exploring into electropop, synthpop  and techno. The album has also a more R&B/urban sound and recording with new producers such as Danja. Blackout was her first studio album in four years since 2003's In the Zone  and is the first time Spears is the executive producer of one of her albums. The album's title refers to \"blacking out negativity and embracing life fully\".  The songs on the album are thematically focused on sex, love and Spears' relationship–struggle with the media.\n\nBlackout debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, becoming her first and so far only studio album not to debut at number one due to a last-minute rules change by the Billboard music association. According to the IFPI, the album was 32nd in terms of units shipped by the end of 2007.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Gimme More\", peaked at number one in the Canadian Hot 100 and became a top five hit in twelve countries. The second single, \"Piece of Me\", reached number one in Ireland. The final single, \"Break the Ice\", reached number one in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, making all the singles of the album go to the top position of at least a chart. All three songs frequently appeared on the lists that included the best records of the year. Even though initial critical response was mixed to positive, the album later won high critical acclaim and appeared on many lists that included the decade's best albums. The album was named the 5th \"Best Pop Album of the Decade\" by The Times, the 7th-best album of the decade on the Rolling Stones \"The Decade-End Readers’ Poll\", and the 3rd Best Album of the decade on the Billboard \"Readers Poll\", and won \"Album of the Year\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008. To date, the album has sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/Blackout\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
