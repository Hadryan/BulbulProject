Then without any outside influences the whole band set the lyrics to music.\nLike in every album in \"Give Me Fire\" the band recreated itself, but still in their individual, typical Mandostyle. It sounds like coming right from the sixties. Partly consciously and partly unconsciously they added elements of Latin, Soul, Disco and Retro to their normal Garage-Indie-Rocksound. \nCharacteristically for \"Give Me Fire\" is the difference between all tracks, which still follow a well considered common conception. This makes listening to the sounds of this album like watching a sweeping motion picture. \nMando Diao focused a lot on the musical version. The backing vocals are often sung by women and extraordinary instruments like violins, trumpets and harmonicas are supporting the booming bass. But in some songs, \"Crystal\" for example, they work with about 8 guitars. \nIt is surely worth it listening to the igneous sounds of “Give Me Fire”, so come on come on, put your high heels on and buy this record.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mando+Diao/Give+Me+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
