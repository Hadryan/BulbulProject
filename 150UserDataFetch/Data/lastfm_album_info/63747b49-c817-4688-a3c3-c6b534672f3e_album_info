Released on September 24, 1991 through Jive Records, the album produced three singles; \"Check the Rhime\", \"Jazz (We've Got)\", and \"Scenario\".\n\nAfter A Tribe Called Quest's debut album, People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990), Jarobi White left the group to study culinary art. Phife Dawg learned that he was diabetic a month after the album's release and after a discussion with fellow member Q-Tip, they agreed to increase his participation on their second album and to \"step it up in general as a group.\"Q-Tip credited N.W.A's album Straight Outta Compton (1988) as an inspiration for the record. The group hired double bassist Ron Carter on the track \"Verses from the Abstract\". Q-Tip stated, \"We wanted that straight bass sound, and Ron Carter is one of the premier bassists of the century.\" Carter agreed to record tracks on the condition that the group avoid profanity, to which Q-tip assured they were addressing \"real issues\".\n\nThe Low End Theory is stylistically reminiscent of mid-1980s hip hop. Producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad and rappers Q-Tip and Phife Dawg showcase how rap was done before commercial success influenced many rappers' creativity. The album's minimalist sound is \"stripped to the essentials: vocals, drums, and bass.\" The bass drum and vocals emphasize the downbeat on every track.\n\nThe Low End Theory helped shape alternative hip hop in the 1990s. It established the musical, cultural, and historical link between hip hop and jazz. Writer Oliver Wang called the album \"a consummate link between generations\", which took the essence of jazz and hip hop, and \"showing they originated from the same black center.\" The group's \"mellow innovations\" helped jazz rap gain significant exposure from 1992 to 1993. Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 154 in \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", stating that \"people connected the dots between hip-hop and jazz -- both were revolutionary forms of black music based in improvisation and flow -- but A Tribe Called Quest's second album drew the entire picture.\"\n\nIn Time magazine's \"ALL-TIME 100\" albums, Josh Tyrangiel called the record an exception to jazz rap often being \"wishful thinking on the part of critics\". He described the album as \"socially conscious without being dull\" and likened a few tracks to \"smoky rooms where cool guys ... say cool things.\"Pitchfork Media listed the album at number fifty-six in its \"Top 100 Albums of the 1990s\". The Low End Theory was voted at number thirty-two in The Village Voice's 1991 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Allmusic writer John Bush, who declared it \"the most consistent and flowing hip-hop album ever recorded\", summed up the record as \"an unqualified success, the perfect marriage of intelligent, flowing raps to nuanced, groove-centered productions.\" On February 1, 1995, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/A+Tribe+Called+Quest/The+Low+End+Theory\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
