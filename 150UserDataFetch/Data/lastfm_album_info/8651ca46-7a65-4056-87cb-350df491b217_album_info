It is their 7th album released on Matador and the eighth album to be given Matador's Buy Early Get Now treatment. It comes along with a vinyl LP featuring Yo La Tengo’s Original Score from the Motion Picture Adventureland.\n\nFive videos were made by director John McSwain to accompanying one song from the album each. In the weeks leading up to the release of the album, a new video was posted on Matador's various \"partner sites\" and collected on Matador's own website. The first video, for \"Here to Fall\", was posted on Matador's own \"Matablog\" on July 28, 2009.\n\nThe album leaked onto the Internet on July 26; in response, Matador began streaming the album to Buy Early Get Now customers on July 28, more than a week before the stream was originally advertised to begin. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/Popular+Songs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
