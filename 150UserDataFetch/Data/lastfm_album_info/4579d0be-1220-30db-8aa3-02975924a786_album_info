Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"), as his lyrics continued their trend toward the abstract and personal.\n\nBringing It All Back Home is often cited as the birth of folk rock, and one of the peak albums of Dylan's career.\n\nThe album reached #6 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan's LPs to break into the US top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that Spring. The lead-off track, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
