It was their fourth studio album, and the first with the classic Mk II lineup. Deep Purple in Rock was their breakthrough album in Europe and would peak at #4 in the UK, remaining in the charts for months. Album was supported by the hugely successful In Rock World Tour which lasted 15 months.\n\nAlthough this was the first studio album to feature the MK II lineup of the band, it was this lineup that had earlier recorded the Concerto for Group and Orchestra.\n\nDeep Purple's earlier work ranged from psychedelic hard rock to orchestra-driven tracks and covers that ranged from The Beatles to Neil Diamond, among others, but on this record all tracks are credited to the five members of the band. \"Speed King\" and \"Flight of the Rat\" are hard rock songs, and the 10-minute epic \"Child in Time\", perhaps the most famous song from this record, would be a concert staple for years to come.\n\nAlthough \"Into the Fire\" and \"Speed King\" were featured on the set lists at the time, \"Child in Time\" was the only song from this album that was included on Made in Japan two years later (although \"Speed King\" was the usual encore and is featured on the expanded CD re-issue, as is \"Black Night\" which was included in the Deep Purple in Rock re-issue).\n\nThe cover depicts the band in a rock sculpture inspired by Mount Rushmore.\n\nIn 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 78 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\n\nJon Lord used both the Leslie speaker, and a Marshall amplifier with his Hammond organ, therefore the organ sound varies a lot throughout the songs. (Example: \"Living Wreck\" - Leslie speaker, \"Hard Lovin' Man\" - Marshall amplifier).\n\nRitchie Blackmore used a Gibson guitar on \"Child in Time\", not his usual Fender Stratocaster. This album is his favorite, along with Machine Head.\n\nIn some countries including Mexico, Deep Purple in Rock also included \"Black Night\", a single recorded during the sessions.\n\nThe US release of the album cut the intro to Speed King, lasting just over a minute. It remains edited on the standard Warner Bros. US release, but is restored to full length on the 25th anniversary package (released in 1995).\n\nOn July 21, 2009 audiophile label Audio Fidelity released a remastered version of Deep Purple In Rock on a limited edition 24 karat gold CD. Mastering for the CD was performed by notable audio engineer Steve Hoffman. This release follows the original 7-track format with no bonus tracks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple/Deep+Purple+In+Rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
