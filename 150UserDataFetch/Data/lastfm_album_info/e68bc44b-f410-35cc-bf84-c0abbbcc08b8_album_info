The first single, \"That I Would Be Good\", was moderately successful, and two other tracks, \"King of Pain\" (a cover of the song by The Police) and \"You Learn\" were released as singles outside North America. \n\nIn addition to material from Morissette's first two U.S. albums, MTV Unplugged featured performances of three previously unreleased songs from her tours: \"No Pressure over Cappuccino\", \"Princes Familiar\" and \"These R the Thoughts\". Morissette has stated that \"Princes Familiar\" in particular is one of her favourite and most vocally challenging songs.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alanis+Morissette/MTV+Unplugged\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
