'Things Are What They Used To Be' has by no means strayed from the dark and atmospheric, hooky and melodic road, but what we now hear is a strikingly upfront, passionate, personal development. The euphoric title track emphasises the want to return to how things once were in another state of mind, time and place, and highlights the dynamic of Zoot Woman today... a return to form. Right from the pulsing hook line of 'We Won't Break', feeding an addiction to emotional melody in 'Lonely By Your Side' and 'More Than Ever', then to be shaken up by the pounding stadium electro of 'Witness'. Not to mention the pristine pop of 'Just A Friend Of Mine' and desperate yearning of 'Memory'. 'Blue Sea' is a delicate departure, craving escapism, relief and change in order to remedy something. Prominent moments include the dirty, sexy 'Lust Forever', 'Saturation' and the love and obsession fuelled 'Live In My Head'. The cerebral track 'Take You Higher' is an almost psychedelic dream as the record takes a breath. Zoot Woman brings with this new album a sound and collection of songs so fresh that still carries the essence of what we know and love. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Zoot+Woman/Things+Are+What+They+Used+To+Be\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
