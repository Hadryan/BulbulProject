But the rights had already been granted to a TV/movie company, so the album's title was altered slightly by removing the comma, and the theme and lyrics were made to be more generically about robots rather than specific to the Asimov universe.\n\nThe cover inlay reads: \"I ROBOT... THE STORY OF THE RISE OF THE MACHINE AND THE DECLINE OF MAN, WHICH PARADOXICALLY COINCIDED WITH HIS DISCOVERY OF THE WHEEL... AND A WARNING THAT HIS BRIEF DOMINANCE OF THIS PLANET WILL PROBABLY END, BECAUSE MAN TRIED TO CREATE ROBOT IN HIS OWN IMAGE.\"\n\nThe title of the final track, \"Genesis Ch.1 v.32\", follows this theme by implying a continuation to the story of Creation, since the first chapter of Genesis only has 31 verses. The track \"Don't Let it Show\" was later covered by Pat Benatar on her album \"In the Heat of the Night\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Alan+Parsons+Project/I+Robot\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
