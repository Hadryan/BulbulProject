It is produced by Showtime, and distributed by Milan Records.\n\nThe album contains 25 tracks over 1 hour and 4 minutes. Track 1 is the opening theme by Rolfe Kent. Tracks 2 through 11 are mostly Cuban and Latin music used during the show, with tracks 2, 6 and 9 containing narration by Michael C. Hall. Tracks 12 through 24 were written by Daniel Licht, who composed all of the show’s other themes. Bonus track 25 is track 24, “Blood Theme”, with Jon Licht singing over. Kent’s widely praised opening theme utilises an eclectic selection of European and Asian instruments, including ukulele, piano, bouzouki, trumpets, pizzicato strings, electric piano, saz, and tambour, set to an Afro-Cuban beat. Licht’s original themes are based around a mixture of Latin and electronic music, reflecting Dexter’s warm and cold elements.\n\nTracklisting :\n\n1. Rolfe Kent - Dexter Main Title (1:39)\n2.
