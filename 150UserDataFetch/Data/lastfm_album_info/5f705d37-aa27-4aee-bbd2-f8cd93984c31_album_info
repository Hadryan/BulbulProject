The album was recorded between June and November 2012, during promotion of her sixth studio album, Talk That Talk (2011). As executive producer, Rihanna enlisted previous collaborators The-Dream, David Guetta, Chase & Status, and StarGate to work alongside new collaborators such as Mike Will Made-It and Labrinth. Its music incorporates pop, EDM, and dubstep styles, much in the vein of Talk That Talk and Rated R (2009). The album features guest vocals from ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, Eminem, Future, and Mikky Ekko.\n\nUpon its release, Unapologetic received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who found its music interesting, although some criticized its lyrical content. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 238,000 copies, becoming Rihanna's first number one album on the chart and best-selling debut week of her career. The album also became Rihanna's third, fourth and fifth consecutive number one album in the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland, respectively.\n\n\"Diamonds\" was released as the album's lead single on September 27, 2012. It peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, in addition to topping charts in fifteen other countries worldwide. The album was promoted by the 777 Tour prior to its release, and will be supported by the Diamonds World Tour beginning in March 2013.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Unapologetic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
