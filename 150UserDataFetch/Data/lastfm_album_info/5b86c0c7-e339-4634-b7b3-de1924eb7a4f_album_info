Produced by David Gilmour, Martin Glover, Andy Jackson and Phil Manzanera, the album is set to be released by Parlophone and Columbia Records respectively in Friday-release countries on 7 November 2014 and in the United Kingdom and North America on 10 November 2014.\n\nDescribed as a \"swan song\" for keyboardist Rick Wright (who passed away in 2008), the album mostly comprises instrumental music (and one song, \"Louder Than Words\", co-written by Gilmour's wife and frequent lyricist Polly Samson) initially recorded during the 1993 sessions for The Division Bell, with additional work taking place in 2013 and 2014 aboard Gilmour's Astoria recording studio. Additional musicians include bassist Guy Pratt and backing vocalist Durga McBroom, who previously participated in recording The Division Bell. \n\n\"The Endless River has as its starting point the music that came from the 1993 Division Bell sessions. We listened to over 20 hours of the three of us playing together and selected the music we wanted to work on for the new album. Over the last year we've added new parts, re-recorded others and generally harnessed studio technology to make a 21st century Pink Floyd album. With Rick gone, and with him the chance of ever doing it again, it feels right that these revisited and reworked tracks should be made available as part of our repertoire.\" - David Gilmour\n\n\"I think this record is a good way of recognizing a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was.\" - Nick Mason\n\nDavid Gilmour - Guitars, Piano, Hammond Organ, Synthesizer, Keyboards, Bass Guitar, Percussion, Effects, Lead and backing vocals, Spoken Word\nRichard Wright - Acoustic and Electric Pianos, Hammond Organ, Royal Albert Hall pipe organ, Synthesizers, Keyboards, Spoken Word\nNick Mason - Drums, Percussion, Spoken Word\n\nWith\n\nGuy Pratt - Bass Guitar\nJon Carin - Synthesizers, Keyboards, Percussion\nBob Ezrin - Bass Guitar, Keyboards\nAnthony Moore - Keyboards\nAndy Jackson - Bass Guitar\nDamon Iddins - Keyboards\nGilad Atzmon - Saxophone, Clarinet\nDurga McBroom - Backing Vocals\nSarah Brown - Backing Vocals\nLouise Marshall - Backing Vocals\nVictoria Lyon - Violin\nHonor Watson - Violin\nChantel Leverton - Viola\nHelen Nash - Cello\nStephen Hawking - Spoken Word <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Endless+River\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
