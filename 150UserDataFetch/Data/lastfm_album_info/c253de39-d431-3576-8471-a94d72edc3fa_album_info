It is her first release since the greatest hits compilation Ultimate Kylie (2004), and her first studio album since Body Language (2003). X was preceded by lead single \"2 Hearts\" and released worldwide in November 2007. The American release of X took place in April 2008, preceded by the single \"All I See\". The final single from the album was \"The One\", released in Australia on 28 July 2008.\n\nWork on the album began following Minogue's gradual recovery from breast cancer and subsequent radiotherapy treatment. Her cancer, which was diagnosed in May 2005, resulted in the postponement of Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour tour midway through its run. Minogue resumed the tour in late 2006, in the midst of recording X, and was completed later in the following year.\n\nIn addition to generally positive critical reception, X debuted at number one in Australia and at number four in the United Kingdom. The album was nominated for a BRIT Award for International Album, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album, making it Minogue's fifth Grammy Award nomination. According to The Times, the album had sold one million copies worldwide as of December 2008.\n\nX debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart with first-week sales of 16,000 copies, giving Minogue her third number-one album in her native Australia. The album remained in the top fifty for fourteen weeks, ultimately earning a Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments in excess of 70,000 copies. Additionally, it was the forty-ninth best-selling album in Australia for 2007. In New Zealand, however, it became Minogue's lowest-charting studio album to date, spending a sole week at number thirty-eight on the RIANZ Albums Chart.\n\nX debuted number four on the UK Albums Chart, selling 82,370 copies in its first week.It spent twenty-eight consecutive weeks in the top 100, subsequently returning to the chart at number ninety-nine on 7 August 2008 for an additional week. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the album Platinum on 30 November 2007, having sold 463,056 copies in the United Kingdom as of July 2010. In the United States the album charted at number 139 on the Billboard 200 and at number four on the Top Electronic Albums chart, selling 6,000 units in its first week and 42,000 altogether.[42] The album saw considerable charting success across continental Europe, reaching the top ten in Switzerland; the top twenty in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, and Ireland; the top thirty in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden; and the top forty in Denmark and Italy. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/X\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
