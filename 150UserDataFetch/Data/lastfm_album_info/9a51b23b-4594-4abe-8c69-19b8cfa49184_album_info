It is considered a shift from Anathema's original death/doom metal style, becoming a more soft side of doom metal.\n\nThe title of the album is derived from Leslie Watkins' book entitled Alternative 3. Bassist Duncan Patterson had read it a few years before they wrote the album. The book is about conspiracy theories, and most songs on \"Alternative 4\" are about trust. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Anathema/Alternative+4\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
