The first CD version to be released featured several longer edits compared to the vinyl version. It was recorded in \"Sweet Silence Studio\" in Copenhagen and took about 7 weeks.\n\nA remastered CD reissue was released in May 1999, which restored the artwork of the original release. This has two tracks of a longer duration than on the first US CD issue.\n\nThis album is generally referred to in reviews as a commercial effort by the band, attempting to repeat the success of the song \"I Surrender\" and the album \"Difficult to Cure\". As a result, some of the songs, like the first single released from this album, \"Street of Dreams\", are usually considered to be more in the album-oriented rock style, instead of the hard rock sound of earlier Rainbow albums. The album was particularly aimed at the US market; the title is an American idiom rather than a British one.\n\nThe music video for \"Can't Let You Go\", directed by Dominic Orlando, was filmed in New York City (1984) and inspired by the 1920 silent b/w film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\". Along with \"Street of Dreams\", directed by Storm Thorgerson (1983), it became a part of Rainbow's \"The Final Cut\" home video collection (1985).\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rainbow/Bent+Out+of+Shape\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
