The ballad \"Tears of the Dragon\" stayed for many months on top the of charts in countries like Brazil where Dickinson has a large fanbase.\n\nThis record marked the beginning of Dickinson's collaborations with Roy Z, who would work on many of Dickinson's later albums including Accident of Birth, The Chemical Wedding and Tyranny of Souls. Stylistically it departs from Tattooed Millionaire but is still more traditional-sounding than the follow-up album Skunkworks released in 1996. Later, Dickinson said that he and Roy Z were talked into making the album less heavy than it should have been.\n\nBalls to Picasso was also released in DVD-Audio 5.1 mix and DualDisc (CD/DVD-Audio 5.1 mix) versions. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Dickinson/Balls+to+Picasso\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
