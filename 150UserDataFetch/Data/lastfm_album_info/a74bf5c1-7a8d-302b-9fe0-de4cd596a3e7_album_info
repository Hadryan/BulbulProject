The album features guest appearances from the Balanescu Quartet, The London Community Gospel Choir and Dr. John. The title comes from the philosophical novel Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder, the context being:\n\n“Only philosophers embark on this perilous expedition to the outermost reaches of language and existence. Some of them fall off, but others cling on desperately and yell at the people nestling deep in the snug softness, stuffing themselves with delicious food and drink. 'Ladies and Gentlemen,' they yell, 'we are floating in space!' But none of the people down there care.”\n\nThe album itself was recorded shortly after the break-up of Spiritualized's Jason Pierce and Kate Radley, the band's keyboard player. Radley had secretly married Richard Ashcroft of The Verve in 1995. Pierce, however, has maintained that much of the album, including songs such as \"Broken Heart\" and \"Cool Waves\", had actually been written before the break-up. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Spiritualized/Ladies+and+Gentlemen+We+Are+Floating+in+Space\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
