After a period of being out of print while 4AD reclaimed the American distribution rights for their back catalog, this (along with much of the band's 4AD material) was remastered by Robin Guthrie and re-issued in 2003. The album shares its name with a peak in southern Utah, Bluebell Knoll.\n\nBlue Bell Knoll was listed by Pitchfork Media as the 81st best album of the 1980s, describing it as a return to the band's ethereal style explored on Treasure. It was also appraised as \"everything that atmospheric music should be and usually isn't.\" NME also viewed Blue Bell Knoll positively, placing it at #33 in Albums of the Year 1988 while Melody Maker placed it at #6 in their Albums of the Year 1988.\nA less favourable response came from Robert Christgau, who criticized the \"momentary momentum\" of the record's guitar-playing, and highlighted its supposedly boring nature: \"Ever hear the one about being so open-minded that when you lay down to sleep your brains fall out?\" Allmusic reviewer Ned Raggett awarded the album three out of five stars, saying that \"Blue Bell Knoll has some striking moments that are pure Cocteaus at their best\" and citing the opening track \"Blue Bell Knoll\", \"For Phoebe Still a Baby\", and the U.S. single \"Carolyn's Fingers\" as highlights, before suggesting that \"things slowly but surely slide back a bit\" afterwards. Drowned in Sound reviewer Gen Williams disagreed, saying in her 2002 review that \"from start to finish, it's a record that gleams with grace and emotion; chiming, mournful guitars and layered tapestry of sounds evoke a vast array of imagery\".\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Elizabeth Fraser, Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde.\n\"Blue Bell Knoll\" – 3:24\n\"Athol-Brose\" – 2:59\n\"Carolyn's Fingers\" – 3:08\n\"For Phoebe Still a Baby\" – 3:16\n\"The Itchy Glowbo Blow\" – 3:21\n\"Cico Buff\" – 3:49\n\"Suckling the Mender\" – 3:35\n\"Spooning Good Singing Gum\" – 3:52\n\"A Kissed Out Red Floatboat\" – 4:10\n\"Ella Megalast Burls Forever\" – 3:39\nPersonnel\n\nElizabeth Fraser - vocals\nRobin Guthrie - guitar\nSimon Raymonde - bass guitar <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cocteau+Twins/Blue+Bell+Knoll\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
