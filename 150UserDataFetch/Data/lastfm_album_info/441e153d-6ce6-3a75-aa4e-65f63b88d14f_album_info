It sees Björk creating an introverted, quiet world of swirling microbeats and personal lyrics. On the cover she can be seen wearing the swan dress (designed by Marjan Pejoski) that caused a stir at the 2001 Academy Awards.\nBjörk uses an array of sampled objects to create beats and soundscapes in a number of songs on Vespertine, including shuffling cards on \"Cocoon\" and \"Hidden Place\"; snow being walked upon on \"Frosti\", and ice being cracked and smashed on \"Aurora\".\n\nVespertine is Björk's longest album, at 55:33 (apart from compilations).\n\n\"Hidden Place\", \"Pagan Poetry\" and \"Cocoon\" were released as singles from the album. A rumoured fourth single, \"It's Not Up to You\", never made it to release, presumably because of the birth of Björk's daughter Isadora.\n\nThe lyrics to \"An Echo, A Stain\" are taken from Sarah Kane's play Crave.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Harm of Will\" were written by Harmony Korine and are about Will Oldham.\n\nThe last track on the album, \"Unison,\" uses a sample of St Paul's Cathedral Choir singing a segment of Patrick Gowers's Viri Galilaei recorded in 1994. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bj%C3%B6rk/Vespertine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
