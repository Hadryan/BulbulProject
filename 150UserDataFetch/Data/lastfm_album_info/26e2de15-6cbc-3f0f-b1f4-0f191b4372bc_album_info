The album was out of print from around 1997 to 2005 due to the much publicized falling out between Nine Inch Nails' core member, Trent Reznor, and the original publishing label of the album, TVT Records. Rykodisc re-released the album around the world in 2005. Pretty Hate Machine is compiled of tracks from the Purest Feeling demo, as well as tracks recorded after the Purest Feeling recording. The album spawned three singles, the most successful being \"Head Like a Hole\", which has become a staple in Nine Inch Nails' live performances. A remastered version was issued on November 22, 2010.\n \nHistory\nWorking nights at Right Track Studio as a handyman and janitor, Reznor used studio \"down-time\" to record and develop his own music. Playing most of the keyboards, drum machines, guitars, and samplers himself, he recorded a demo. The sequencing was done on a Macintosh Plus.\n\nTeaming up with manager John Malm, Jr., they sent the demo to various record labels. Reznor received serious offers from many of them, but eventually signed a deal with TVT Records who, until then, were known mainly for releasing novelty and television jingle records. Pretty Hate Machine was recorded in various studios around the world with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: Flood, Keith LeBlanc, Adrian Sherwood, and John Fryer. Much like his recorded demo, Trent Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording Pretty Hate Machine mostly by himself.\n\nReleased on October 20, 1989, the album was a critical and commercial success, receiving radio airplay for the singles \"Down in It\", \"Head Like a Hole\" and \"Sin\". The songs \"Terrible Lie\" and \"Something I Can Never Have\" also received moderate airplay along with the three lead singles. Pretty Hate Machine also gained popularity through word-of-mouth and developed an underground following. Reznor quickly hired a band for touring with The Jesus and Mary Chain, including guitarist and future Filter frontman Richard Patrick. Nine Inch Nails' live set during the time was known for louder, more aggressive versions of the studio songs, and also for destroying their instruments at the end, (Reznor preferred using the heel of his boots to strip the keys from expensive keyboards, most notably the Yamaha DX7).\n\nSince the album was released, a recording known as Purest Feeling surfaced. This bootleg album contains the original demo recordings of most of the tracks found on Pretty Hate Machine, as well as a couple that were not used (\"Purest Feeling\", \"Maybe Just Once\" and an instrumental intro to \"Sanctified\" called \"Slate\").\n\nPretty Hate Machine went out of print through TVT Records, but was reissued by Rykodisc on November 22, 2005 with slight changes in the packaging. Reznor had expressed an interest in creating a \"deluxe edition\" with surround sound remastering and new/rare remixes, similar to the re-release of The Downward Spiral. Rykodisc liked the idea, but wanted Reznor to pay them to handle the process of remastering, repackaging, and re-releasing the album.\n\nOn March 29th, 2010, the master recording rights of Pretty Hate Machine were acquired by The Bicycle Music Company, and on October 22nd, 2010, Trent Reznor announced on nin.com that on November 22nd, 2010, a remastered issue of the album would be released by UMe and The Bicycle Music Company. The re-release includes slightly different cover art by Rob Sheridan and the bonus track \"Get Down, Make Love\", a Queen cover originally found on the \"Sin\" single.\n\nLeading up to the re-release of the album, a website was put up for fans at http://phm.nin.com/, featuring content from videos and tours for Pretty Hate Machine. The videos for \"Head Like a Hole\" and \"Down in It\" featured newly remastered sound, the uncut video for \"Sin\" (a remix for the video was used, so it was not remastered) and two early live video segments; one with interviews.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and composed by Trent Reznor. \n\n1. \"Head Like a Hole\"   Trent Reznor, Flood 4:59 \n2. \"Terrible Lie\"   Trent Reznor, Flood 4:38 \n3. \"Down in It\"   Trent Reznor, Keith LeBlanc, Adrian Sherwood 3:46 \n4. \"Sanctified\"   Trent Reznor, John Fryer 5:48 \n5. \"Something I Can Never Have\"   Trent Reznor, John Fryer 5:54 \n6. \"Kinda I Want To\"   Trent Reznor, John Fryer 4:33 \n7. \"Sin\"   Trent Reznor, John Fryer, Keith LeBlanc 4:06 \n8. \"That's What I Get\"   Keith LeBlanc, John Fryer 4:30 \n9. \"The Only Time\"   Trent Reznor, John Fryer, Keith LeBlanc 4:47 \n10. \"Ringfinger\"   Trent Reznor, John Fryer 5:40 \n11. \"Get Down, Make Love\" (Queen cover, bonus track on 2010 reissue only) Al Jourgensen (credited as Hypo Luxa) 4:19 \nTotal length: 48:41 \nNotes\nSome of the lyrics printed in the booklet are not heard in the songs.\n\nThe bands listed in the liner notes (Prince, Jane's Addiction, and Public Enemy, amongst others) were sampled on the album. Parts of Prince's \"Alphabet St.\" and Jane's Addiction's \"Had a Dad\" are prominently heard in \"Ringfinger\", while other samples were either edited or distorted to be unrecognizable, such as the intro to \"Kinda I Want To\".\n\nJohn Fryer's name is misprinted as John Fruyer.\n\nThe 2010 remastered issue was mastered by Tom Baker at Precision Mastering in Hollywood, California.\n\nA speech from the film Midnight Express was sampled at very low volume during the music break in \"Sanctified\". On the 2010 reissue of the album, this sample is no longer present.\nTrent Reznor – vocals, arranger, programming, producer, engineer, digital editing, mixing, song writer \nChris Vrenna – programming, digital editing \nDoug d'Angelis – engineer \nTony Dawsey – mastering \nFlood – programming, producer, engineer \nJohn Fryer – producer, engineer, mixing \nKennan Keating – engineer \nKeith LeBlanc – producer, engineer, remixing, mixing \nRichard Patrick – guitar (drone guitar at the end of \"Sanctified\") \nKen Quartarone – engineer \nAdrian Sherwood – producer, engineer, mixing \nJeffrey Silverthorne – photography \nGary Talpas – cover design \n2010 Remaster\n\nTom Baker - Mastering \nTrent Reznor - Mastering \n\nGet Down Make Love (Bonus Track):\n\nTrent Reznor - performer & engineer \nAl Jourgensen - producer, intro samples & engineer \nJeff \"Critter\" Newell - engineer \nSean Beaven - engineer \nFreddie Mercury - song writer (originally performed by his band Queen) \n\nChart history\nAlbum Year Title Chart Position \n1990 Pretty Hate Machine Billboard 200 No. 75\n\nSingles Year Title Chart Position \n1989 Down in It Hot Dance Music/Club Play No. 16 \n1989 Down in It Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales No. 20 \n1989 Down in It Modern Rock Tracks No. 16\n1990 Head Like a Hole Hot Dance Music/Club Play No. 17 \n1990 Head Like a Hole Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales No. 34 \n1990 Head Like a Hole Modern Rock Tracks No. 28\n1990 Sin Hot Dance Music/Club Play No. 10 \n1990 Sin Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales No. 13 \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/Pretty+Hate+Machine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
