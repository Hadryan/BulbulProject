This was the record that helped the group transcend their previous death/thrash style, deepening their forays into hardcore punk, industrial music and Brazilian-styled percussion. It would later become one of the founding pillars of the groove metal subgenre.\n\nIt won silver and gold certifications throughout Europe and the USA, and was considered their first step into the metal mainstream\n\nOut of the boredom of playing the Arise songs for two years straight and the threat of musically stagnating, Sepultura pushed the envelope on Chaos A.D. The first track, \"Refuse/Resist\", revealed the band's new musical direction: slower, with more emphasis on groove than speed. The song starts with the heartbeat of Max's then-unborn first son, Zyon, followed by some Afro-Brazilian drumming reminiscent of Salvador, Bahia samba-reggae group Olodum. About the track's introductory guitar riff, Max acknowledged that it \"could have been created by a death metal band.\"\n\nDiversity was the key to Chaos A.D., revealed Max Cavalera. \"Biotech is Godzilla\" was \"pure hardcore\", according to the elder Cavalera. \"Nomad\", with its characteristically slow riffs, was described Max as the answer by lead guitarrist Andreas Kisser to Metallica's \"Sad But True\". The album also featured Sepultura's first all-acoustic incursion, \"Kaiowas\". \"It's like a mixture of Led Zeppelin, Sonic Youth and Olodum\", said Max of that particular song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sepultura/Chaos+A.D.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
