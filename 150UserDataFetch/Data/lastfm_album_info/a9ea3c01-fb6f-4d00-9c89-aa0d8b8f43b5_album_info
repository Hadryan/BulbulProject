The tracks have their remixed versions on a 2004 remix album aMotion.\n\nIt has been speculated that the title is a reference to the Twelve-step program. According to Keenan on the commentary for the aMotion DVD, the album is a concept album with all of the songs dealing with the problem of addiction from a different perspective. He said that it refers in a way to his 13 years of residence in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\" is a cover of the song by Failure, originally featured on the 1996 album Fantastic Planet.\n\n\"Pet\" has its follow-up, \"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\", with the same lyrics, on the band's following 2004 cover versions album Emotive. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/A+Perfect+Circle/Thirteenth+Step\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
