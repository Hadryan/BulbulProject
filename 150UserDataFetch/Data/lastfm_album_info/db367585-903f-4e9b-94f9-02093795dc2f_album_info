The album debuted at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200; this is a relatively high position for an acoustic EP. It included several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as three new acoustic tracks. One new song, \"Touché\", featured Godsmack's first guitar player, Lee Richards, as well as John Kosco, who were at that time in the now defunct band Dropbox, The other two new acoustic tracks were \"Running Blind\" and \"Voices\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Godsmack/The+Other+Side\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"On March 16, 2004 The Other Side, an acoustic EP was released from Godsmack.

The song \"Asleep\" is actually an acoustic version of \"Awake\" from the band's second album Awake. Godsmack shifted from its \"heavy\" sound to a more mellow acoustic sound on this EP in the same manner Alice in Chains did in the Sap and Jar of Flies EPs, one of many similarities to Alice in Chains for which the band has been criticized.\n\nIn 2004, Godsmack opened for Metallica's \"Madly in Anger with the World tour\", and headlined the tour along with Dropbox. Afterwards, in Autumn 2004, the band played several acoustic shows to promote The Other Side, while at the same time continuing to open for Metallica. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Godsmack/The+Other+Side\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
