It was placed at #14 in Channel 4's 100 greatest albums of all time and in 2006 at #33 in NME's 100 greatest British albums. Despite the album's critical and commercial success, lead singer Chris Martin said that Coldplay looks beyond Parachutes. \"We know that's terrible music,\" he said, \"and we always try to think about what we can do next.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Parachutes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
