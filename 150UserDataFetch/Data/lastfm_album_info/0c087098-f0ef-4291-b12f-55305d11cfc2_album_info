The album was released in Finland on September 14, 2005 and internationally on September 19, 2005 under the Century Media label. It is the first Children of Bodom album to feature guitarist Roope Latvala (Stone, Sinergy, ex-Waltari), due to the departure of Alexander Kuoppala. In this album, the band has chosen the dropped C tuning (usually tuned in D tuning), which differs from the \"whole step down\" tuning previously employed. The power metal influences previously prominent are also greatly reduced in this album.\n\nAre You Dead Yet? is the first Children of Bodom album to have two singles from it. \"Trashed, Lost & Strungout\" was released as an EP and single in 2004, and \"In Your Face\" was released in August 2005 shortly before the album. It was also their first album with three music videos, with their third video being the title track.\n\nIf You Want Peace... Prepare for War is the English translation of the Latin phrase Si vis pacem, para bellum.\n\nThe title track's video was shot in part at the Tavastia club in Helsinki, Finland on February 13, 2006. Additional footage for the video was filmed in the U.S. The clip received its premiere in the US on MTV Headbangers Ball on March 18, 2006 wherein the band made a special appearance.\n\nThe name of the album and its title track was conceived by Alexi Laiho after an alcohol-related injury. He alludes to this during the band's concert DVD, Chaos Ridden Years, and in a magazine article, says: \"I came up with the new album title last winter when we were back home and I went out for a night of drinking. I got hold of some of the cheapest vodka and just drank and drank and drank, and one thing led to another, so we were outside having fun, and I climbed on top of a car, and slipped and fell off, and next thing I know I was in hospital. I had three broken bones in my wrist and lots of stitches, got kept in over night. So when I woke up the next morning I obviously wasn’t feeling too good. I looked in the mirror and said to myself, ‘Have you had enough? Are you dead yet?’\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Children+of+Bodom/Are+You+Dead+Yet%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
