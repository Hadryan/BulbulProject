The video's popularity led to an attack from k-os, one of the most prominent Canadian hip-hop artists. Following the video's release, shot by K'naan and a film crew in Kenya, k-os rapped on the track B-Boy Jizzle: \"They took cameras to Africa...oh yes the great pretenders/Religious entertainers who want to be life savers.\" The album won Canada's Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year in 2006, and was shortlisted for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize. It was also included in The Guardian's November 2007 list of 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die.\n\nAfrica-savvy critic extraordinaire Robert Christgau gave the album an A, calling African hip-hop 'awkwardly derivative' but K'naan \"some kind of miracle worker\"...\"After rapping phonetically to CDs mailed to Mogadishu by his father, an intellectual turned immigrant cabdriver, K'naan finally escaped Mogadishu himself and learned English from scratch--and his skills are gigantic. What accent he has is subsumed in his high, sharp, unexpectedly comedic flow. He embellishes his simple beats with deft choruses and tunelets, and his African effects are savvy and unforced...Before you assume the guy is kinda soft, imagine the war-zone childhood described in 'What's Hardcore?'. He thinks you're soft, and will take you down if you get in his way.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/K%27naan/The+Dusty+Foot+Philosopher\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
