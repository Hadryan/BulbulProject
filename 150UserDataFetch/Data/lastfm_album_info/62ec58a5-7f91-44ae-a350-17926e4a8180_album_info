While they were no longer desperately poor and starving for a hit, the band wondered whether they'd be able build on, or at least maintain the level of achievement the years of recording and touring had brought them. The sessions for their follow-up LP, Point of Know Return, were filled with tension as singer/songwriter Steve Walsh, who had always been uncomfortable with the artistic direction of the band, left the group briefly. Years later, Walsh would admit in an interview with nationally-syndicated radio host Redbeard on the weekly rockumentary series In the Studio with Redbeard (edition #849, week of 9/27/04 and again on the 30th Anniversary Episode for Point of Know Return in 2007) that he had been something of a prima donna at this point. The other members of the group talked him into returning and the sessions continued. As with the previous album, it was a last-minute addition to the track line-up that would prove to be a huge success.\n\nKerry Livgren had been practicing with his acoustic guitar, working on a chord progression that he had written as a finger exercise. His wife, Vicci, happened to hear what he was doing and remarked that the melody was nice and that he should write lyrics for it. The result was a short song called Dust in the Wind. Again, Livgren was unsure as to whether his fellow band members would like it, since Kansas was not known for acoustic ballads. Needless to say, the song was recorded, securing Kansas's place in the annals of classic rock.\n\nThe album marked the commercial peak of the band in many ways. A subsequent tour brought them to the largest venues in the country, such as Madison Square Garden (which was sold out resulting in a second show at the newly constructed nearby Nassau Coliseum on Long Island) and the LA Forum (on New Year's Eve 1977). Marketing efforts were escalated at that point, including a tour book featuring an essay about the band by then Rolling Stone contributor Cameron Crowe. The band became a staple on FM radio at this point, and during this period was one of the most popular rock acts in the country.\n\nDetailed description\nPoint of Know Return begins with a song of the same title, clocking in at 3:13. It was a later addition to the album, along with giving the album its name. After this track is \"Paradox\", in which the violin takes center stage as a solo instrument in an extension of the prototypical Kansas style. Following is the band's first ever instrumental \"The Spider\", composed by Steve Walsh and so named for its alleged likeness to the arachnid. This piece segues into a song written about Albert Einstein, \"Portrait (He Knew)\". \"Portrait\" is a straightforward collection of rock riffs and somewhat strained phrases, building upon a relentless theme and weaving a unique patchwork of counterpoint. \"Closet Chronicles\" is a Howard Hughes allegory, which is an unusual subject for a progressive rock epic. Nonetheless, this song includes a unique instrumental break and makes use of the contrasting vocal timbres of Steve Walsh and Robby Steinhardt. Next is a somewhat dated generic rock tune called \"Lightning's Hand.\" In this song, Steinhardt attempts vocal caricatures similar to Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins in their respective tenures in the British progressive rock group Genesis. Following this song is the work in which many listeners judge the band, \"Dust in the Wind\". The song does not really reflect any other song in the entire Kansas canon in many ways, and is known for its sparse acoustic nature. In this song the band explores the prospect of death and the insignificance of one lifetime in the endless thread of time. \"Sparks Of The Tempest\" comments upon the cyclical nature of rebellion and the claim of power through a purely Kansas-esque brand of accessible rock. \"Nobody's Home\" chronicles an alien encounter with the world of a fallen civilization, and reflects the pensive atmosphere of \"Dust.\" This song makes effective use of Robby Steinhardt's skill on the violin, particularly in the climax of the instrumental break. The album closes with \"Hopelessly Human\", a progressive epic in the vein of those on Leftoverture. The piece features many instrumental solos.\n\n\nCommercial success\nPoint of Know Return would be Kansas' highest charting album in the US, peaking at #4 in January 1978, and would sell four million copies in the US and be certified Quadruple Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\"Point of Know Return\" – 3:13 \n\"Paradox\" – 3:50 \n\"The Spider\" – 2:05 \n\"Portrait (He Knew)\" – 4:38 \n\"Closet Chronicles\" – 6:31 \n\"Lightning's Hand\" – 4:24 \n\"Dust in the Wind\" – 3:28 \n\"Sparks of the Tempest\" – 4:18 \n\"Nobody's Home\" – 4:40 \n\"Hopelessly Human\" - 7:17 \n\"Sparks Of The Tempest (Live)\" - 5:17 \n\"Portrait (He Knew) (Remix)\" - 4:49 \n\nTracks 11 & 12 Appear Only On The 2002 Reissue\n\n\nBand\nPhil Ehart - drums \nDave Hope - bass \nKerry Livgren - guitars, keyboards \nRobby Steinhardt - violins, vocals \nSteve Walsh - keyboards, vocals \nRich Williams - electric guitars \nNote: The album's performing credits listed one joke \"instrument\" for each band member, such as \"chain-driven gong,\" \"autogyro,\" \"Rinaldo whistling machine\" and \"Peabody chromatic inverter.\"\n\n\nAdditional personnel\nRick Williams - pedals \n\nProduction\nProducer: Jeff Glixman \nEngineers: Terry Becker, Jeff Glixman \nMastering: George Marino \nArranger: Kansas \nArt direction: Tom Drennon \nCover art concept: Kansas \nCover design: Rod Dyer \nArtwork: Peter Lloyd \nArtwork: Bob Maile \n\nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1978 Pop Albums 4 \n\nSingles - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Single Chart Position \n1977 \"Point Of Know Return\" Pop Singles 28 \n1978 \"Dust In The Wind\" Pop Singles 6 \n1978 \"Portrait (He Knew)\" Pop Singles 64 \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kansas/Point+of+Know+Return\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
