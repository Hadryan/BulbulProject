Critical success endured, and the album was widely listed among the greatest albums of the 2000s in many popular publications, including 3rd place in Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums of the 2000s. It was Wilco's first album with drummer Glenn Kotche, and the last with multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Jay Bennett. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wilco/Yankee+Hotel+Foxtrot\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
