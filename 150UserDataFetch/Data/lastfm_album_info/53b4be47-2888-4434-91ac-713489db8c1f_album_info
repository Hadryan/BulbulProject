Until now. With a uniquely emotional electronic production style every bit as deeply personal and impassioned as his voice or songwriting, James Blake is sketching out his own totally unique place in the musical universe.\n\nAlthough loosely tethered to the cutting edge of contemporary electronics, James’s songs possess uncommon grace and soulfulness. Whether intended for the dance floor or, like new single ‘Limit to Your Love’, destined to melt hearts and prick ears, his music is characterized by a playful and arresting honesty, a human touch that, despite his status as a hugely in-demand DJ, naturally aligns him with contemporary artists such as Bon Iver or Laura Marling or the xx.\n\nYet more than this, it is the shock of the new in James’s music that’s causing real commotion: the sounds, that voice, the silence, the rhythm (or lack of it), the waiting, the tension. You have to know the rules in order to break them with such conviction, and by daring to be different, James stands head and shoulders above his peers. No doubt, you’ll remember where you were when you heard tracks like ‘Limit to Your Love’ or ‘I Never Learnt to Share’ for the first time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/James+Blake/James+Blake\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
