It is her first studio album since 2007's Trip the Light Fantastic. \n\nMake a Scene originated from recording sessions for a Greatest Hits compilation set for release in the autumn of 2007. The success of those recording sessions led Ellis-Bextor and her record label at the time, Fascination Records, to change their plans and record a full studio album instead. Following the release of several singles in 2009 and 2010, the album title was announced in early 2010, and subsequently changed to Straight to the Heart later that spring. Ellis-Bextor changed the album title back to Make a Scene in late 2010 and announced the final album title in a posting on her Facebook account  in January 2011.\n\n\"Bittersweet\" was released in May 2010 as the album's first solo single. Prior to that, Ellis-Bextor featured on two singles as a guest vocalist: \"Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)\" with Freemasons, released in June 2009, and \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" with Junior Caldera, released in February 2010. A third collaboration, \"Not Giving Up on Love\" with Armin van Buuren, was released in August 2010. The album's 2011 release will coincide with the release of \"Starlight\" and \"Off & On\" in different territories. On 19 April, it was made available to stream on Sophie's official MySpace.\n\nMake A Scene features production by Fred Ball, Armin van Buuren, Junior Caldera, Freemasons, Calvin Harris, Greg Kurstin, Liam Howe, Metronomy, Richard Stannard, and Richard X.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sophie+Ellis-Bextor/Make+a+Scene\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
