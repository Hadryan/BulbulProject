Produced by Rick Rubin and Daron Malakian, Steal This Album! was recorded in mid-2002 and released on November 26, 2002 by American Recordings. The album reached No. 15 in the Billboard Top 200.\n\nThis album was released shortly after a collection of medium-quality MP3s found their way onto the Internet under the unofficial name Toxicity II, a year after the release of the group's multi-platinum record, Toxicity. The band issued a statement expressing their disappointment that their fans were hearing unfinished material, and released the finished versions of the leaked material. Most, but not all tracks from the original leak (e.g. \"Cherry\") made it onto Steal This Album!, and three new tracks such as \"Roulette\" were also added. Many song titles, lyrics, and melodies were changed, making the new album significantly different from the unfinished product.\n\nThough often reported in the media as being a collection of B-sides and outtakes, the band insists that the Steal This Album! material is of the same quality as the tracks which made it onto Toxicity. Vocalist Serj Tankian has said that the songs were left out of Toxicity \"because they didn't fit the overall continuity of the album\".\n\nThe album title is a reference to Abbie Hoffman's book Steal This Book, which is regarded by many as a classic example of counterculture literature. A similar title (\"Steal This Movie!\") was used for a movie about Hoffman's life. A year prior to this album however, The Suicide Machines had already released an album titled Steal This Record. The Coup had also released a Steal This Album in 1998. The title of track 12, \"Fuck The System\", is probably also based on the Abbie Hoffman book of the same name. It certainly could be argued that, like Hoffman, System of a Down have used some of their lyrics to discuss radical political opinions. The choice of album title could also be interpreted as being a reference to the Recording Industry Association of America's campaign against peer-to-peer MP3 file-sharing, which attracted significant mainstream media attention, both before and since the album's release. Given the aforementioned history of the album, such a view is given credence. It could also be interpreted as a message to those who leaked the unfinished, unmastered versions of the songs, on the Internet.\n\nAn alternate version of \"Streamline\" was used in The Scorpion King soundtrack, which was released in early 2002, and as a B-Side on some copies of the Aerials single.\n\nThe packaging for this album is unique. The album comes in a normal CD jewel case without a booklet, just the CD. On the CD and back of the case, it looks like it has been written on with a black marker pen, in faux-bootleg style to make it look like it has been pirated.\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Daron Malakian – guitar, vocals\n    * Serj Tankian – vocals, keyboard\n    * Shavo Odadjian – bass\n    * John Dolmayan – drums\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/Steal+This+Album%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
