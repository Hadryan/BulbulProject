As a so-called post-punk record, it exhibits a tendency in bands from their time to take the then nascent punk rock style and experiment with its manifestations. This is definitely not a typical punk record in the sense of The Ramones' quick pop riffing or The Velvet Underground's too-cool to care attitude; Gang of Four's particular twist on the punk sound featured here used generally quick tempos as usual, but a different rhythmic attack with angular, sharp chords that stabbed into the music with staccato accents against a funkier, jammier bass and drum backdrop. The lyrical matter deals with Marxist politics and sociological critiques that reflected the band's own postmodern political bent. Many modern punk bands are certainly indebted to the sonic work this band did long ago, and this record is often cited as a touchstone influence. In fact, direct sonic followers The Futureheads employed Gang of Four's guitarist on this album (and others), the inimitable Andy Gill, to produce their studio LPs. Entertainment! is, without a doubt, one of the finest punk records ever. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Gang+of+Four/Entertainment%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
