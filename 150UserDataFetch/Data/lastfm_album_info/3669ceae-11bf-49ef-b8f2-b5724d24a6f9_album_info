The experimental, avant-garde style would be further explored on \"Heroes\" and Lodger. The album's working title was New Music Night and Day.\n\nThe genesis of Low lies in both the foundations laid by Bowie's previous album Station to Station, and music he intended for the soundtrack to The Man Who Fell to Earth. When Bowie presented his material for the film to Nicolas Roeg, the director decided that it would not be suitable. Roeg preferred a more folksy sound, although John Phillips (the chosen composer for the soundtrack) described Bowie's contributions as \"haunting and beautiful\". Elements from these pieces were incorporated into Low instead. The album's cover, like Station to Station, is a still from the movie: the photographic image, under the album's title, formed a deliberate pun on the phrase \"low profile\".\n\nDavid Bowie – vocals (2-6, 8, 10-12, 14), saxophones (4, 11), guitar (6, 9-11), pump bass (6), harmonica (7), vibraphone (9-10), xylophone (10), pre-arranged percussion (10), keyboards: ARP synthesiser (1, 10), Chamberlin: Credited on the album sleeve notes as \"tape horn and brass\" (1), \"synthetic strings\" (1, 4, 9-10), \"tape cellos\" (5) and \"tape sax section\" (7), piano (7, 9-11), \"instruments\" (13)\nBrian Eno – keyboards: splinter Minimoog (2), report ARP (3), rimmer E.M.I.
