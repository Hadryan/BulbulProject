It was released on July 18, 2005 in the UK, on November 1, 2005 in the USA, Canada and Mexico, and re-released through White Rabbit Recordings in the UK on April 17, 2006. The album was written, produced, arranged, and funded by Heap, without the backing of a record label, and features guest appearances from Jeff Beck, who does a guitar solo on \"Goodnight and Go\", and Heap's boyfriend, Richie Mills, who argues with her on \"The Moment I Said It.\" It was released in the UK through her own label, Megaphonic Records, in a special digipak created specifically by Heap, before being licensed to White Rabbit Recordings in 2006 for the UK and international markets. It is licensed to RCA Victor in the USA, where the first run of 10,000 copies were copy protected and encased in the digipak (further editions are in a standard jewel case with a cardboard slipcase). As of August 2009, it has sold 431,000 copies in the USA according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album has also achieved gold status in Canada.[6]\n\n\"Hide and Seek\" and \"Goodnight and Go\", the album's lead and second single respectively, were both featured in episodes of the US TV drama The O.C., as was \"Speeding Cars\". \"The Moment I Said It\" was used in the Criminal Minds episode called \"Seven Seconds\". \"Can't Take It In\" was featured in film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. \"Clear the Area\" was sampled by rapper / lyricist Saint. \"Hide and Seek\" was also used as the soundtrack for an advert by Sky promoting the Series 5 Finale of a television series, Lost. In 2009, \"Hide and Seek\" was sampled as the hook in the lead single for Jason Derulo, titled \"Whatcha Say\". The track \"The Moment I Said It\" was used for a group routine on season 3 of the show, So You Think You Can Dance choreographed by Mia Michaels. Rapper XV also sampled the track \"Speeding Cars\" for the song \"Textbook Stuff\" which featured Kendrick Lamar.\n\nSpeak for Yourself, was re-released digitally in Deluxe, Standard and Instrumental versions on 24 December 2012. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Imogen+Heap/Speak+for+Yourself\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
