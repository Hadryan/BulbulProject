A video for the first single from the album, Salute Your Solution was released on the same day.\n\nCritique of Consolers of the Lonely was largely positive; much of it centered on the chaotic sound and diverse nature of the album as well as its reminecense to albums by Led Zeppelin and The Who. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Raconteurs/Consolers+of+the+Lonely\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
