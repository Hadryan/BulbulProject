Producer Squeak E. Clean adds subtle layers of keyboards, sirens, bells, handclaps; five of the 11 songs utilize acoustic guitar, all prominently.\n\nIt was originally stated that the album was to be a concept album about the lead singer Karen O's cat entitled Coco Beware, but this turned out to be untrue.[2] The cat does exist, but belongs to a friend of Karen's.\n\nIn December 2006, the album was named the second best album of the year by NME magazine, as well as \"Cheated Hearts\" being voted the 10th best song. Rolling Stone magazine named it the 44th best album of 2006, while Spin magazine ranked it number 31 on their 40 best albums of 2006.\n\nFollowing its release, the album debuted at number 11 on the U.S. Billboard 200, with about 56,000 copies sold in its first week.[3]\n\nIn an interview with Blender magazine, the bands says during the writing and recording that they had almost broke up, calling that time one of their \"darkest\" moments. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yeah+Yeah+Yeahs/Show+Your+Bones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
