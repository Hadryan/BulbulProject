The album also contains two cover songs: \"Little Honda,\" a Beach Boys tune by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, and \"My Little Corner of the World,\" written by Bob Hilliard and Lee Pockriss and made famous by musician and anti-gay activist Anita Bryant.\n\nI Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is among the most critically acclaimed albums by Yo La Tengo, placing 5th in the Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1997. The album has continued to earn acclaim since its release, ranking at #25 on the list of the Top 100 albums of the 1990s by Pitchfork, and #78 on Spin's greatest 90 albums of the 1990s. Robert Christgau, in his review for Spin, called the first nine songs \"perfect.\" He called out the song \"Autumn Sweater\" as the \"very peak\" of the album and  described the track \"Stockholm Syndrome,\" sung by bassist James McNew, as a \"simulated Neil Young ballad.\" He referred to the album as one of his \"favorite albums of the year, easy,\" alongside those by Pavement, Sleater-Kinney, and Arto Lindsay. In his review of the band's 2003 album Summer Sun, he praised I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One as Yo La Tengo's \"career album.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo/I+Can+Hear+the+Heart+Beating+as+One\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
