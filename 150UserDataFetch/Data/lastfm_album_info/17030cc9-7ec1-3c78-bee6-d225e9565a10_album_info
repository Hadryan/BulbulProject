The album features vocals from the Long Winters frontman John Roderick. The album was recorded in two sessions at Hall of Justice in Seattle and Tiny Telephone in San Francisco.\n\nThe album was met with moderate success and favorable reviews. Critic Marc Hogan of Pitchfork wrote that the album is \"another often-compelling set of melancholic post-Coldplay guitar-pop, made grittily optimistic by the tribulations of post-hipster existence\".\n\nAccording to NPR's program, All Songs Considered, the band says the album \"answers questions of lust and deception, greed and love, joy and regret and the rites of passage you weren't quite ready to pass through\". \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nada+Surf/The+Weight+Is+a+Gift\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
