It was released in the United Kingdom seven years later on 4 August 2008 as Experience: Expanded, with a gold cover and two extra tracks. Experience has been well-received critically. Allmusic gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, opining that it \"shows the Prodigy near the peak of their game from the get go\" and stating that \"almost every song sounds like a potential chart topper\". All songs written and composed by Liam Howlett.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/Experience\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
