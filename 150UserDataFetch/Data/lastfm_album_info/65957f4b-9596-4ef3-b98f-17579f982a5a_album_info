The recording sessions didn't seem to have been easy, not the least because Placebo chose Phil Vinall in the last minute for what would be the album's first single, \"Pure Morning\". Later on, Placebo's frontman, Brian Molko stated that, despite appreciating Osborne's producing skills, the chemistry between band and producer \"didnt spark the way we wanted it to spark\", also adding that the album was \"overproduced\" and contained \"too many slow songs for a second album\". This said, he didn't disown the album all the same, adding that it is still an album the band is proud of.\n\nThe song Pure Morning was the first Placebo single to have moderate success in the USA.\n\nThe voices heard on \"Evil Dildo\" were taken from Brian Molko's answer machine, after he received a series of lewd prank phone calls; the dialogue is in fact from the end of Aphex Twin's song \"Funny Little Man\" found on his Come to Daddy EP. The song \"Pure Morning\" was featured in the 2004 film The Chumscrubber. \"My Sweet Prince\" was featured in the soundtrack on the second series of \"Trigger Happy TV\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Placebo/Without+You+I%27m+Nothing\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
