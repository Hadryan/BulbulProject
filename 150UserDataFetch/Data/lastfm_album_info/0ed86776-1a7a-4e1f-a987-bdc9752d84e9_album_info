Most of the songs were recorded between 2004 and 2006 and released as series of ad hoc EPs and sold at shows by the band. The band came to the attention of Killer Pimp owner Jon Whitney in late 2006 and he asked if he could have the songs remastered and release them as an album on CD. The band deliberated over whether or not this would be a good move for some time, but finally came to an agreement and the album was  released as a limited edition in August, 2007. The limited edition soon sold out and several repressings were undertaken. As of March 2008 further pressings are ongoing. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/A+Place+to+Bury+Strangers/A+Place+To+Bury+Strangers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
