A loose concept album about \"the urban dispossessed\" of New York City, Rain Dogs is generally considered the middle album of a trilogy that includes Swordfishtrombones and Franks Wild Years.\n\nThe album, which includes appearances by guitarists Keith Richards and Marc Ribot, is noted for its broad spectrum of musical styles and genres, described by Rolling Stone as merging \"Kurt Weill, pre-rock integrity from old dirty blues, [and] the elegiac melancholy of New Orleans funeral brass, into a singularly idiosyncratic American style.\"\n\nThe album peaked at #29 on the UK charts and #188 on the US Billboard Top 200. In 1989, it was ranked #21 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 greatest albums of the 1980s.\" In 2003, the album was ranked number 397 on the magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\n\nPitchfork Media listed Rain Dogs as 8th best album of the 1980s. Slant Magazine listed the album at #14 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Rain+Dogs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
