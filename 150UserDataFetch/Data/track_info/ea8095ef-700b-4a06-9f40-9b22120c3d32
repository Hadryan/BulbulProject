The song was produced by group members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann, under their production alias Bobbydazzler, for the group's debut album Since I Left You. The song is built around many sampled elements, much like other tracks from its parent album, including prominent vocal samples of comedy duo Wayne and Shuster and an orchestral background sourced from an Enoch Light version of the composition \"My Way of Life\" (1968).\nIt was released on 21 August 2000 as the second single from Since I Left You. Upon release, it peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart and number 49 in the group's native Australia, becoming their first single to enjoy commercial success. \"Frontier Psychiatrist\" was well received by music critics, who praised the Avalanches' utilization of samples in making the song.\n\nBackground:\n\nAccording to group members, \"Frontier Psychiatrist\" was not planned beforehand by the group and in his words, \"just happened from us just fucking around.\" Group members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann were driving figures in the production of the album's songs, spending months scouring Melbourne's \"old record stores for old records\" and spending hours sampling music from the records they found to create the songs on the album. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. Dexter Fabay, turntablist and keyboardist for the band, brainstormed the idea for \"Frontier Psychiatrist\", and his scratching abilities are heard prominently on the song.\n\nComposition:\n\n\"Frontier Psychiatrist\" is built around several elements sampled from other music; Chater and Seltmann, who produced the song, sampled music from several vinyl records in the production and creation of the songs from Since I Left You. The song also makes prominent use of scratching done by the band's turntablist Dexter Fabay.\nThe prominent orchestral sample heard throughout the track is sourced from a recording by the Enoch Light Singers of the 1968 composition \"My Way of Life\", originally composed by Bert Kaempfert, Herbert Rehbein and Carl Sigman.\nThe track also contains several vocal samples of Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster, the most prominent of these samples taken from the duo's comedy routine \"Frontier Psychiatrist\"\nOnly the aforementioned two samples are credited in the liner notes of Since I Left You; various other uncredited samples are used in the song, with sources ranging from golf instructionals, Christianity records and \"Reading for the Blind\" tapes.\nThe spoken sample at the beginning (\"Is Dexter ill?\") comes from the John Waters film Polyester, followed by Maurice Jarre's overture from Lawrence of Arabia.\nThe closing mariachi band played \"El negro Zumbon\" first performed by Silvana Mangano in the movie Anna.\n\nMusic Video:\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Kuntz and Maguire, features various characters re-enacting and playing various elements of the track, including vocal samples, violins, horns and drums.\nThe video was released to critical acclaim. The video was the runner-up in the \"Best Music Video\" category at the 2002 Rushes Soho Shorts Film Festival. Pitchfork Media placed the video at #19 on their list of the \"Top 50 Music Videos of the 2000s\".\nAn alternative video was made, featuring actors acting out the 'dialogue' of the track in various scenes, including a psychiatrist's office and \"Dexter's\" bedroom. In addition, Rorschach ink-blots are animated to reflect various samples in the track. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Avalanches/_/Frontier+Psychiatrist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
