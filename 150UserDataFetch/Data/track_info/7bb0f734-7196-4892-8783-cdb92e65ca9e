The video features footage of the band performing in the wilderness accompanied by imagery from the album,\n\nAt this stage in their career the band had recorded little material to be used as B-sides, which is why the Arise singles are so similar. It is interesting to note that this single and the next, Under Siege (Regnum Irae) have the exact same artwork (a detail of the Arise album cover artwork by Michael Whelan) and B-sides. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sepultura/_/Dead+Embryonic+Cells\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
