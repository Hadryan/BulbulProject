The song also features in the movie Graffiti Bridge.\n \nWhile specific recording dates are not known, initial tracking took place in July, 1987 at Paisley Park Studios, Chanhassen, MN, USA, during the first recording sessions to take place there (during the same set of sessions as Melody Cool, No Changes and a re-recording of If I Love You Tonight, now titled If I Love U 2 Nite). Graffiti Bridge marks the earliest recording from Paisley Park Studios to be released with Prince vocals, therefore. An early version of the song was included as the third track on a 25 September, 1988 configuration of Graffiti Bridge. It was included as the 13th track on a late 1989 configuration. Vocal and instrumental overdubs took place in late 1989 or early 1990 at Paisley Park Studios, and during the same time period, Clare Fischer recorded string overdubs at Mad Hatter Studios, Los Angeles, CA, USA. It was included as the 16th track on a 1990 configuration of the album, where it remained for release.\n \nThe movie Graffiti Bridge was developed starting in September, 1987, indicating that the theme of Graffiti Bridge was conceived to some degree before the movie itself.\n  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Graffiti+Bridge\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
