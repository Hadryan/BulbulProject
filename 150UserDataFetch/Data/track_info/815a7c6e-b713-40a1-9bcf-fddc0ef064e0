According to the Honey Songfacts, Carey was the first act to achieve this feat.\n\nThe song is best known for its music video, which presented a more sexual and less conservative image of Carey than had been previously seen. It also marked a musical transition in her career, moving her away from pop music and further towards hip hop. \"Honey\" was nominated for the 1998 Grammy Awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song.\n\nThe song enjoyed several remixes, both hip hop and dance, the most notable being  \"Honey\" (So So Def mix), produced by Jermaine Dupri and \"Honey\" (Classic mix) by David Morales <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/Honey\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
