Many of the musicians appearing on it also appeared on his 1972 album Harvest, and it is considered by many to be like a \"sequel\" to Harvest.\nRecovering from a case of tinnitus that had come about after the recording of 1990's Ragged Glory and its subsequent tour (which produced 1991's Weld and Arc), Young was determined to return to the studio. Returning to Nashville and joining up with compatriots like Ben Keith, Young put down the electric guitar, returning to the acoustic guitar, piano and banjo that had dominated albums such as Harvest, Comes a Time and Old Ways.\nThe album earned the 1994 Juno Award for album of the year. The 2009 release Dreamin' Man is a live album of the subsequent 1992 tour and contains live renditions of all Harvest Moon tracks in a different order.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/_/Harvest+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
