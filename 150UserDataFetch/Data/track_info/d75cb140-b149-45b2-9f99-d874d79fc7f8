At a concert in Columbus, Ohio on May 17, 2008, lead singer Scott Weiland said that he and STP drummer Eric Kretz wrote the lyrics in a hot tub after hearing the news story. \n\nThe song was released in 1993 as Core's second single and became a major rock radio hit in the U.S. \"Plush\" won in the category of \"Best Hard Rock Performance\" at the 1994 Grammy Awards.\n\nWeiland and STP guitarist Dean DeLeo performed an acoustic version of \"Plush\" on the MTV show Headbanger's Ball that was also very popular. It was originally only available on a CD single from England for their single, \"Creep\", but is now featured on the band's \"greatest hits\" compilation, Thank You, along with the original electric version. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stone+Temple+Pilots/_/Plush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
