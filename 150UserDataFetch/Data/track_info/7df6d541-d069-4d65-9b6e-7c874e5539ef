In order to make the song more reasonable for radio play, it was shortened from the nearly eleven-minute version on Blackwater Park to just over five minutes. The song itself remains a firm fan favorite, being a popular part of most live performances. The song is usually used by the band as a closing song.\n\nThe shortened version consists of the first 5:05 of the song, fading out just before the growling vocals start.   <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Opeth/_/The+Drapery+Falls\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"The Drapery Falls\" is a promotional single for the Opeth album, Blackwater Park.
