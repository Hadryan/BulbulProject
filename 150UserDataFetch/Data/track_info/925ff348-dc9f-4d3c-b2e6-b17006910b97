It also appeared later in compilations like Crossroads and The Cream of Clapton. This track is mainly composed of guitar solos and is stated by Eric Clapton himself as being somewhat similar to Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway To Heaven'.  The song starts quietly with Clapton singing some introspective lyrics referencing 'Crossroads,' which became a theme of his career after the early defining moment of Cream's version of the song.  Background singers Marcy Levy and Yvonne Elliman join Clapton on the chorus as the song builds.  It comes to an instrumental climax at the end, with a building mellotron line over guitar arpeggios. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton/_/Let+It+Grow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
