The song's vocals are notable in part because of the snorting sound heard around 5:30.\n\nJimmy Page used his 1962 Lake Placid blue Fender Stratocaster for the first time on this track, which was supplied to him by Gene Parsons. Evidence of its usage is clearly present as Page executes numerous \"dive bombs\" on the instrument's tremolo arm. He would later use it with his band The Firm.\n\nIn an interview he gave to rock journalist Cameron Crowe, Page commented on the spontaneous nature of the song's construction, saying that it \"was made up in the studio, right on the spot\".\n\nThe lyrics, written by Robert Plant, express his discontent with the rock lifestyle. Plant has also indicated that one part of the song also had to do with a friend of his who got sucked into the Los Angeles drug scene, to whom he wags a finger and says \"watch it.\"\n\nThis song was never performed live by the band at Led Zeppelin concerts until their reunion show on December 10, 2007 at The O2 in London.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/For+Your+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
