A review by Aidin Vaziri from Rolling Stone called the song \"a pulsating, cool-headed R&B concoction\" and praised the group for their mature sound which made \"other girl groups...look utterly lightweight in comparison\". \n\nDebbie Guirand, in a review for ManHunt.com, called the song \"catchy\" and was impressed by the Sugababes' ability to write their own lyrics as they had done for \"Overload\". James Kimmitt, in a review for Drowned in Sound, was also impressed by the group's writing abilities and called the song \"brilliant\". \n\nAlthough The Portland Mercury was not impressed by the Sugababes' debut album, giving it only two and a half stars out of five, the online entertainment website did give \"Overload\" positive reviews. The website called the song \"joyously overwhelming\" and gave it four out of five stars.\n\nMusic video\n \nSugababes in the music video for \"Overload\". From left to right: Mutya Buena & Keisha Buchanan.The music video for \"Overload\" was directed by Phil Poynter and filmed in London, England in mid-2000.\n\nThe video has no plot and is known for its fresh and simplistic style, a theme that they would continue in their early videos. It features the group in a variety of ever-changing outfits, singing the song in front of a plain white background, either by themselves or together as a group.\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sugababes/_/Overload\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
