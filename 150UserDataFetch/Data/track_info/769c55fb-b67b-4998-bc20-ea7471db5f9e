The song was also a big hit in what was West Germany, reaching #4, and in Canada, reaching #6. \n\nIt was famously used as part of the Live Aid concert in 1985, as the background music to a montage of clips showing poverty-stricken Africa and was then re-released in the UK, this time charting at #4. The music video for the song stars, besides Ocasek and Orr, Czech-born supermodel Paulina Porizkova, who later married Ocasek. The video was directed by actor Timothy Hutton. \n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cars/_/Drive\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
