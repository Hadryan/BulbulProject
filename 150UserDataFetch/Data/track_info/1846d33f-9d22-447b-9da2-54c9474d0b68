The B-side was the instrumental \"Alexa de Paris\", one of the few tracks from this project featuring a guitar solo, and is one of a handful of instrumental tracks that Prince recorded in the '80s. Both songs appear in the film Under the Cherry Moon, with the video for \"Mountains\" playing as the credits roll. The version shown on MTV to promote the single was in color as opposed to the film's black and white version <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Mountains\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
