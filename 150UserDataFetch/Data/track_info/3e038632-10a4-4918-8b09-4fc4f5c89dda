It was also the band's first Top 10 hit in the UK, peaking at number eight, besting the number eleven peak of \"Plug In Baby\".\n\nThis song is notable for Chris Wolstenholme's groovy synth-bass riff that was inspired by Michael Jackson.\n\nThe video depicts a number of military officials seated at a round table performing actions simultaneously, moving to the beat of the song, as Muse play the song on the table, with the officials apparently oblivious to Muse's presence. Eventually, the officers begin to start dancing on the table, seeming to go insane. They eventually end up crawling. It is partially based on Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\n\nTime Is Running Out was featured on the FLYING-DOG Soundtrack \nThe song has been featured in an episode of Entourage entitled \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" and in 2008, the song was featured on Torchwood Declassified, to represent the deaths of two main characters. \nIn 2006, the song was featured in the trailer for the film Running Scared and was also used in promotional spots of the Turner Classic Movies channel. \nIn 2005, The Feeling covered the song for Jo Whiley's Live Lounge on Radio One. They apparently did not know what the song was called or who it was by when they covered it. \nThe song has been featured in the book Blue Bloods by Melissa De La Cruz. \nThis song was used during a montage of Usain Bolt's 2008 Olympic performance on NBC. \nA string version by The Section Quartet[1] was played in an episode of Gossip Girl entitled \"New Haven Can Wait\" on October 14, 2008. \nThe song was played during the late night Hollyoaks special \"Back From The Dead\". \nThe song was used during an Australian Beach Cricket game on Channel 9 after returning from a commercial break, and in doing so has become part of the elite class of songs that have been used as bumper music. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Time+Is+Running+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
