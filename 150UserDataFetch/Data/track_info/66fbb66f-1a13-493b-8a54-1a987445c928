It was remixed slightly for its single release, bringing the guitar elements further forward in the mix. Club remixes were produced by Juno Reactor. Lyrically the song casts Siouxsie Sioux as a dreamer who looks up at the stars and wishes for a better life and to \"escape this straight-jacket of constraint\".\n\n\"Stargazer\" did not chart in the United States. It peaked at number sixty-four in the UK singles chart. Shortly after the release of this single, Siouxsie & the Banshees disbanded, leaving Siouxsie Sioux and Budgie to direct their priorities to their side-project The Creatures. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees/_/Stargazer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
