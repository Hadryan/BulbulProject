I never will.\"\n\n\"This is a very sad song, but if you're like me, I always find the saddest music is also the most beautiful and this is one of my favourite songs that I've ever written\" (from Warszawa album)\n\nAlthough the song was never a regular number in the setlists, it appeared on and off on the band's concerts between 1999 and 2002. A live version is available on the album \"Warszawa\".\n\nIn September 2011 Wilson declared on his Facebook-page that Stop Swimming is one of the 20 songs he's most proud of. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Porcupine+Tree/_/Stop+Swimming\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
