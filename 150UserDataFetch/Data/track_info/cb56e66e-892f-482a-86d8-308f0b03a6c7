It was a B-Side to the UK #1 single \"Some Might Say\" and appears on the B-side compilation album, The Masterplan, as well.\n\n\"Talk Tonight\" is one of many acoustic B-side tracks sung by Noel, and was at the time, the most vulnerable song he had ever attempted. It was inspired by the near-breakup of the band in Los Angeles in autumn 1994, when Noel walked out without telling anyone and headed for San Francisco. He stayed with a girl he had befriended during a previous show there. According to the sleeve notes to The Masterplan, she talked a distraught Noel \"off the ledge\" and took him to the park where she played as a child. It is also mentioned in the Oasis book by Paul Mathurs, Take Me There, that his friend also had an obsession with Snapple Strawberry Lemonade, which contributed to the line in the song, \"all your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade.\" The song also featured on the DVD \"Live By The Sea\" After Noel makes a mistake on the track \"D'Yer Wanna Be A Spaceman?\".\n\nThe song is included on Oasis' compilation album Stop the Clocks.\n\nPaul Weller played keyboards when Oasis performed this song on Channel 4's The White Room in 1995.\n\nAn extract of the song was used in the 2008 GCSE Music Listening Paper Exam. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Talk+Tonight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
