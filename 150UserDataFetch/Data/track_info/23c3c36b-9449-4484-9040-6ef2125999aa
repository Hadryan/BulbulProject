Thom Yorke also had the 1968 adaptation of the play (Romeo and Juliet) in his head:  \"I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. The song is written for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts. A personal song.\" The director of the movie, Baz Luhrmann, revealed in the DVD commentary that he believes it is one of the greatest film exit songs ever written. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Exit+Music+(for+a+Film)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
