I remember one time we went out on the 4th of July. It was dusk and we had a little motorboat, so we went out and the fog was starting to roll. We stopped and all of a sudden we were surrounded by fog. We had no idea where we were. And there was a fog horn.

Things are out of your control. It was just that kind of feeling that I wanted to express.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire/_/Ocean+of+Noise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
