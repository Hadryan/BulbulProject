It had mild success in Ireland reaching #23 and some success in both the UK and the U.S.\n\nAs most of the Cranberries' singles in the United States, a physical CD single was not released commercially, so it did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It did peak at number fourteen on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart, and number twenty in the UK.\n\nThe video clip for \"Ridiculous Thoughts\" was directed on May 1995 by Samuel Bayer, and later redone by the band, using the pseudonym \"Freckles Flynn\".\n\nThe band was shown as the freaks of a circus (the elastic man, the bearded woman, etc.) on a deserted location. It features a young Elijah Wood, who tries to follow some kind of radio signal (which seems to be guided by O'Riordan's voice), all around the ruins of a building.\n\nO'Riordan stated that the band did not understand or identify with the concept that Bayer had shown in the video, and thus, they decided to redo it, mixing the original tape with live footage from their American Tour.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cranberries/_/Ridiculous+Thoughts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
