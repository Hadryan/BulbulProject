The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which Bono tries to convince Hutchence of the act's foolishness.\n\nBono characterized the song as a fight between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence. \"It's a row between mates. You're kinda trying to wake them up out of an idea. In my case it's a row I didn't have while he was alive. I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid soppy fucking song, so I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I'm sorry, but that's how it came out of me.\" --Bono, in Rolling Stone (November 3, 2005 issue) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Stuck+in+a+Moment+You+Can%27t+Get+Out+Of\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
