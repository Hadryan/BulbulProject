Is this song about War? Death? Disease? Satan? Nope. It's a love song! And a rather good one at that! Ozzy is great on vocals and everyone is in fine form with great groove by Geezer and awesome drums from Ward, but the real treat is the keyboard expertise of none other than veteran keyboardist himself, Rick Wakeman of Yes! The song highlights how diverse the band could be and that they could aspire towards Prog like any of their contemporaries. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/_/Sabbra+Cadabra\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"One of the most hypnotic of Iommi riffs in a Sabbath shocker!
