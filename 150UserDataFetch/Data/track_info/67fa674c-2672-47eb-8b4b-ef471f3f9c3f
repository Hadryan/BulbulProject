It features Norwegian model Marianne Schröder with a cameo by Karin.\n\nBeneath the sound of Karin's distinctive singing, lies the story of a restless spirit, who was victim to a car accident.\n\nIn the video, Schröder illustrates the ghost of the victim, haunting the roads. Eventually she tracks down the driver who hit her, to acknowledge her presence and share her story.\n\nThe song contains a sample from Love Me, Love The Life I Lead by The Drifters and another sample taken from Kill Me With Your Love performed by Jericho. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R%C3%B6yksopp/_/What+Else+Is+There%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
