McCartney explained that his mother—who died of cancer when McCartney was fourteen—was the inspiration for the \"Mother Mary\" lyric. McCartney later said, \"It was great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'.\" He also said—in a later interview about the dream—that his mother had told him, \"It will be alright, just let it be.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Let+It+Be\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
