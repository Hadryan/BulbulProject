Fraser's vocal part was recorded just after she was given the news that Jeff Buckley, with whom she had a close personal relationship, was missing in the Wolf River of Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThe song's music video featured a fetus in the womb, lip-syncing the song. It was directed by Walter Stern.\n\nInstrumental portions of the song were used in the opening theme for the U.S. TV series House. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Attack/_/Teardrop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
