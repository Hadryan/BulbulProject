The beginning of the riff shows similarities to Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue\". Bellamy has also stated in a 2005 interview that it elaborates on the riff from DJ Shadow's track Organ Donor.\n\n The bassline has been noted as being very similar to that of Air's single Sexy Boy, which was released 3 years earlier. \n\n\"Plug In Baby\" is a featured song in the rhythm video game Guitar Hero 5. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Plug+In+Baby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
