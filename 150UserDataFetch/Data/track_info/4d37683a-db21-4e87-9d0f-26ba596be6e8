A character (apparently a president or similar leader) gives a speech with the help of a computerised prompter, but the ants' interference causes the prompter to say \"I lied to you. We are the enemy\", which the president reads. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Placebo/_/Infra-Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
