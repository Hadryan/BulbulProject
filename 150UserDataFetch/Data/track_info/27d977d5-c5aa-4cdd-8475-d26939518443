The two songs are very similar in melody and tempo. \"PSA\" was itself later released as a single in 2003, under the title \"Bad Day\". In an interview with Guitar World magazine in the early 1990s, R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck indicated that one of the primary inspirations of \"End of the World\" was Bob Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\".\n\nThe music video was directed by James Herbert, who worked with the band on several other videos in the late 1980s. It depicts a young skateboarder (Noah Ray) rifling through an abandoned, collapsing farmhouse and displaying the relics that he finds to the camera.\n\nOne of REM's best songs. Featured on the Disney film Chicken Little, and in the Sony motion picture Independence Day.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/It%27s+the+End+of+the+World+as+We+Know+It+(And+I+Feel+Fine)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
