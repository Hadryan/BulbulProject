An early version with a slightly different arrangement appears on the group's Peel Sessions 1979-1983 album.\n\nIn 1998 David Guetta & Joachim Garraud and Sash! made remixed versions of the song for the intended second disc of The OMD Singles. The second disc was dropped, and eventually only the Sash! remix appeared on The OMD Remixes EP's. In 2003 the double disc version was released in France only, which included the remixed versions by Guetta and Garraud as well. The Guetta and Garraud remixes were released on a limited 12\" to promote the compilation album.\n\nA live performance of this song, recorded at Guildhall, Portsmouth, England on September 19, 1980 (1980-09-19), is featured in the film Urgh! A Music War.\n\nTitle\n\nThe song is named after the aeroplane, a USAAF B-29 Superfortress called Enola Gay (after Enola Gay Tibbets, the name of the mother of the bomber pilot)  which dropped \"Little Boy,\" the first atomic bomb to be used in an act of War on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. It was an attempt to bring an end to the Second World War, but also killed more than 200.000 civilians. \n\nLyrics\n\nThe lyrics attack the decision to use the bomb, making use of sardonic black humour (\"Is mother proud of Little Boy today?\") and suggesting that the bombing was unnecessary (\"It shouldn't ever have to end this way\").\n\nThe song was also released during a major controversy surrounding then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decision to allow US nuclear missiles to be stationed in Britain.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. \"Enola Gay\" – 3:33\n   2. \"Annex\" – 4:33\n\nUnusually, the 12\" single contained no additional material or alternative mixes, only the same tracks as on the 7\".\n\nChart positions\n\nFrench Singles Chart  - 1\nIrish Singles Chart - 14\nItalian Singles Chart -\t1\nPortuguese Singles Chart - 1\nSwiss Singles Chart -2\nUK Singles Chart - 8\nU.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play - 34\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Orchestral+Manoeuvres+in+the+Dark/_/Enola+Gay\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
