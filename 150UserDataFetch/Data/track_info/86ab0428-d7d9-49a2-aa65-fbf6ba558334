(The graveyard's in the backyard Where the meadow used to be... Mom'll find me by the river)\n\nThe parts in Farsi talking about tears, about sight, about God etc. only bolster this meaning for me: (I swear to God I don't see my family anymore)It's an extremely controversial subject but one CocoRosie as women wanted to tackle somehow - how female power is feared and punished by Islam.\n\nIn her mourning, in her grief\nDon't you miss the way\nThat she brushed her heavy hair\nOh and la la la la la\n\nSo in this part the singer is addressing the man who mutilated and killed the woman, presumably his wife, or perhaps daughter, 'don't you miss the beautiful woman you destroyed?'\n\nAcid burnt face\nClowny tear smile\nShe's the one who made you wild\nShe made you question all your answers\nMade you beg for her forgiveness\n\nSo here is what he's done to her and the reasons for it - the acid has burned her face away leaving a melted, grotesque clowny-looking face - perhaps the lips are burned away so it looks like a crying, clowny smile (I told you this is a really dark, horrible interpretation - but I'm pretty certain it's correct - CocoRosie have a way of taking the most ugly things and taking them beautiful which I really admire.) And he did this to her because she made him question his beliefs - perhaps his faith - and basically she didn't behave right for him and it made him wild, angry, crazy - but now he is perhaps begging for her forgiveness inside because he has done this awful thing but realises it is wrong and misses the memory of her beautiful hair burned away.\n\nBaby girl, don't cry\nMama's gonna buy you a glass eye\nAnd it will glimmer like starlight\n\nIn these acid attacks the eyes are usually destroyed, hence needing glass eyes - I'm guessing perhaps she survived the acid and tried to live on but was too upset by her disfigurement to continue with life, although her mother is trying to comfort her here, I feel.\n\nShe's got no reservations\nAnd got no place to be\nThe graveyard's in the backyard\nWhere the meadow used to be\n\n\nNow in this part I think either the burned girl is ready to die rather than live with her disfigurement or perhaps more likely the man who burned her is consumed with guilt when he looks at what he has done to her and decides to kill her (That earlier line,\"Made you beg for her forgiveness\" suggests he feels some kind of shame or remorse at what he's done).\n\nBecause of her disfigurement or because of her lifelong oppression, \"She's got no reservations/And got no place to be\", no one will miss her so he can safely dispose of her, \"The graveyard's in the backyard\". I also think saying that she has no reservations also refers to what she is being punished for - not showing a proper degree of reservation in her behavior, in her modesty - perhaps she dared to go out with her beautiful hair uncovered?\n\n\nLord knows my destination\nLord hears my inner prayer\nMom'll find me by the river\nSoaking with her party balloons\n\n\nHere are further references to religion, to God, and that this Mother figure who has been present in the background throughout this song knows where her daughter's body is - but will most likely not be telling anybody lest she meet the same kind of fate. These terrible events are hidden within the family and even other women are too scared or too conditioned to come out and protect or report the murders of their daughters, and in that sense are implicated in the crimes. If you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/CocoRosie/_/R.I.P.+Burn+Face\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
