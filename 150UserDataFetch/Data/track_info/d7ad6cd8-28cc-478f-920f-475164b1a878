It also refers to a bird known as the wren, which is reported to be McCartney's favourite. McCartney wrote the tune in the same sort of finger picking style found in \"Blackbird\", \"Mother Nature's Son\" (The Beatles) and \"Calico Skies\" (Flaming Pie). The song earned a nomination for the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney/_/Jenny+Wren\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Jenny Wren was written in Los Angeles, and is about a character of the same name from Charles Dickens' novel \"Our Mutual Friend\".

The song earned a nomination for the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category.\nThe solo is played on an Armenian woodwind instrument, called duduk — a first in pop music history — played by Venezuelan born, world winds specialist & multi-instrumentalist Pedro Eustache. The guitar is tuned down a whole step for the song, providing a unique sound that reflects McCartney's earlier works. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney/_/Jenny+Wren\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
