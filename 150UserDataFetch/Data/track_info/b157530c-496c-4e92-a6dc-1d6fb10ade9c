Jones' song was itself an adaptation of \"Big Road Blues,\" recorded in 1928 by Delta blues musician Tommy Johnson.\n\nWith his knowledge of Eastern music, Wilson used a tambura drone to give the song a hypnotic effect and a psychedelic edge. The song features Wilson as the lead singer and harmonica player. The B-side of the single was entitled \"World in a Jug.\"\n\nThe song also appears in the 1998 movie Hideous Kinky.\n\nHarmonica retuning\n\n\"On The Road Again\" is famous for its harmonica solo, which has a note played in it that is very mysterious as it is not playable without an overblow. Alan Wilson retuned his harmonica's six hole up a half step. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Canned+Heat/_/On+the+Road+Again\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
