The song was originally going to be released on their classic 1966 album Pet Sounds. Mike Love however objected to the title of the song and some of the lyrics and insisted that it be changed. \"I was aware that Brian was beginning to experiment with LSD and other psychedelics,\" explained Love. \"The prevailing drug jargon at the time had it that doses of LSD would shatter your ego, as if that were a positive thing... I wasn't interested in taking acid or getting rid of my ego.\" Jardine recalled that the decision to change the lyrics was ultimately Wilson's. \"Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'\" Terry Sachen, who co-wrote the revised lyrics to this song, was the Beach Boys' road manager in 1966.\n\nThe song was then renamed to \"I Know There's an Answer\" and it was released on Pet Sounds as the ninth track on the album. The lead vocal was sung by Mike Love and Alan Jardine with Brian Wilson singing lead on the choruses. The song was later covered by Frank Black on his eponymous 1993 album. The cover is a departure from the original in style as it is heavily influenced by 80s synthesizer work while staying true to the original. Black even tried singing like Brian on the song. Sonic Youth also did a cover of I Know There's an Answer in 1990. The song appears as a bonus track on the reissue of Goo. \"Hang On to Your Ego\" appears on the reissue of Pet Sounds as a bonus track.\n\nDetails\n\n    * Written by: Brian Wilson/Tony Asher\n    * Time: 3 min 08 sec\n    * Produced by: Brian Wilson\n    * Instrumental track: recorded February 9, 1966 at Western Recorders, Hollywood, California.
