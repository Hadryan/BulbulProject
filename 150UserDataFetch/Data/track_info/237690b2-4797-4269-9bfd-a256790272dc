Keeping in the political themes of the first three tracks, the song deals with capital punishment and the flaws that come with it. The protagonist of the story depicted within the song is an innocent man who is blamed for a crime he didn't do, and is executed via electrocution. It also features some of James Hetfield's highest note-singing (although they are screamed) and a lengthy guitar solo by Kirk Hammett, with lots of tapping at the beginning. It is also a downloaded song in the video game Rock Band. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Ride+the+Lightning\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
