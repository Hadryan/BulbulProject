It was released as a single in 1993 and is also included on the soundtrack to the movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Last Action Hero. It was later released on the 2009 box set Backtracks. It became the band's first #1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart in 1993.\n\nThe music video, directed by David Mallet, begins with Schwarzenegger breaking an entrance door to an AC/DC concert. As he walks around the crowd and the stage, observing each band member, Angus kicks his cap towards him. When Schwarzenegger puts on the cap, his clothes morph into Angus' trademark school uniform costume and signature Gibson SG. He then starts imitating Angus' on-stage antics throughout the video, including a scene in which Angus Young actually climbs up on Schwarzennegger's back and rides around the stage perched on his shoulders while continuing to play his guitar chords. The video also features a young Shavo Odadjian, the future bassist for the Armenian-American alternative metal band System of a Down.\n\nThe video was similar to the one for \"You Could Be Mine\" (released to promote Terminator 2: Judgement Day), where Schwarzenegger interacted with Guns N' Roses.\n\nThe video was released on Family Jewels Disc 3, part of the 2009 box set Backtracks. It was not released on the original Family Jewels, because it contains scenes from the movie and therefore had licencing issues.\n\nAs well as its worldwide release on the Last Action Hero soundtrack, the song can now be found on iTunes with the rest of the soundtrack, making it the only song by AC/DC on iTunes. However, it was recently removed from iTunes along with \"Two Steps Behind\" (Def Leppard). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Big+Gun\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
