Written by Perry, Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo, and produced by the last three, it was released as the album's third promotional single on August 17, 2010. The song was later announced as the album's fourth single and released on February 16, 2011. The single version features vocals by American rapper Kanye West, who also appears in its Floria Sigismondi-directed music video released on March 31, 2011.\n\nOver a \"stomp-stomp-clap\" beat similar to Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" (1977), \"E.T.\" is an electronic ballad that tells of \"falling in love with a foreigner\". Extraterrestrial metaphors are used throughout, and West continues these metaphors in his two verses, making heavy use of Auto-Tune at times. The song peaked at number one in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Poland as well as within the top five in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom and the top twenty in ten other European countries.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe decision to write \"E.T.\" came after its beat was accidentally played in the recording studio—it was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. Admiring its acoustics, Perry chose to work with the track, wishing to write a \"futuristic, alienistic song\". Following up to the release of Teenage Dream, \"E.T.\" was released as the third and final promotional single on August 17, 2010. In December 2010, Perry asked fans for their opinion on Teenage Dream's next single, through the social networking site Twitter. Speculation arose that \"Peacock\" would be its next single, but \"E.T.\" was eventually announced as the record's fourth single through her Facebook page. The announcement was accompanied by the single's artwork, which features Perry with cat eye make-up, bangs, and a sequined top. The single version features vocals from American rapper Kanye West and was released on February 16, 2011.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Ammo – composer, drums, keyboards, programming, producer\n    * Megan Dennis – production coordination\n    * Serban Ghenea – mixing\n    * Jon Hanes – mix engineer\n    * Sam Holland – engineer\n    * Dr. Luke – composer, drums, keyboards, programming, producer\n    * Max Martin – composer, drums, keyboards, programming, producer\n    * Katy Perry – composer, vocals\n    * Irene Richter – production coordination\n    * Tim Roberts – assistant mix engineer\n    * Vanessa Silberman – production coordination\n    * Emily Wright – engineer\n\nCredits adapted from Teenage Dream album liner notes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/E.T.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
