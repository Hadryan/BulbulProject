The French version tells the story of a man, living the end of his marriage, love killed by the boredom of everyday life.\n\n Paul Anka  discovered this song while visiting France, and re-wrote the lyrics as \"My Way.\" Upon returning to the US, he gave it to Frank Sinatra, and it became one of his signature songs. Anka's lyrics changed the meaning to be about a man looking back fondly on a life he lived on his own terms.\n\nBest crooner ever lived, just so easy as Frank sang, if somebody likes  to compare THE Voice no other singer can ever replace him or just imitate this guy!\nUnforgetable voice, nice lyrics highly recomendable!\n\n\nLyrics:\n\nAnd now, the end is here\nAnd so I face the final curtain\nMy friend, I'll say it clear\nI'll state my case, of which I'm certain\nI've lived a life that's full\nI traveled each and ev'ry highway\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\n\nRegrets, I've had a few\nBut then again, too few to mention\nI did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption\nI planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\n\nYes, there were times, I'm sure you knew\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew\nBut through it all, when there was doubt\nI ate it up and spit it out\nI faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way\n\nI've loved, I've laughed and cried\nI've had my fill, my share of losing\nAnd now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing\nTo think I did all that\nAnd may I say, not in a shy way,\n\"Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way\"\n\nFor what is a man, what has he got?\nIf not himself, then he has naught\nTo say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels\nThe record shows I took the blows and did it my way!\n\n\"enstrumental\"\n\nYes, it was my way\n\n\nOriginal French lyrics:\n\nJe me lève et je te bouscule\nTu n'te réveilles pas\nComme d'habitude\nSur toi je remonte le drap\nJ'ai peur que tu aies froid\nComme d'habitude\nMa main caresse tes cheveux\nPresque malgré moi\nComme d'habitude\nMais toi\nTu me tournes le dos\nComme d'habitude\nAlors je m'habille très vite\nJe sors de la chambre\nComme d'habitude\nTout seul je bois mon café\nJe suis en retard\nComme d'habitude\nSans bruit je quitte la maison\nTout est gris dehors\nComme d'habitude\nJ'ai froid\nJe relève mon col\nComme d'habitude\n\nComme d'habitude\nToute la journée\nJe vais jouer\nA faire semblant\nComme d'habitude\nJe vais sourire\nComme d'habitude\nJe vais mÆme rire\nComme d'habitude\nEnfin je vais vivre\nComme d'habitude\n\nEt puis\nLe jour s'en ira\nMoi je reviendrai\nComme d'habitude\nToi\nTu seras sortie\nEt pas encore rentrée\nComme d'habitude\nTout seul\nJ'irai me coucher\nDans ce grand lit froid\nComme d'habitude\nMes larmes\nJe les cacherai\nComme d'habitude\n\nComme d'habitude\nMÆme la nuit\nJe vais jouer\nA faire semblant\nComme d'habitude\nTu rentreras\nComme d'habitude\nJe t'attendrai\nComme d'habitude\nTu me souriras\nComme d'habitude\n\nComme d'habitude\nTu te déshabilleras\nComme d'habitude\nTu te coucheras\nComme d'habitude\nOn s'embrassera\nComme d'habitude\n\n(originally edited by Tedtrivia <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra/_/My+Way\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
