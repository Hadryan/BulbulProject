During this time, Bowie was staying in New York, where he met John Lennon. The pair jammed together, leading to a one-day session at Electric Lady Studios in January 1975. There, Carlos Alomar had developed a guitar riff for Bowie's cover of \"Footstompin'\" by The Flairs, which Bowie thought was \"a waste\" to give to a cover. Lennon, who was in the studio with them, sang \"ame\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and he thereafter wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Fame\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"The Young Americans sessions mostly concluded by late 1974.

Lennon, who was in the studio with them, sang \"ame\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and he thereafter wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song. Lennon performed backing vocals and guitar on the track and worked on the tape loops.\n\nBowie would later describe the song as \"nasty, angry\", and fully admitted that the song was written \"with a degree of malice\" aimed at the Mainman management group with whom he had been working at the time. In 1990, Bowie reflected: \"I'd had very upsetting management problems and a lot of that was built into the song. I've left that all that behind me, now... I think fame itself is not a rewarding thing. The most you can say is that it gets you a seat in restaurants.\" \n\n\"Fame\" became Bowie's biggest hit to that point in the U.S. Bowie would later claim that he had \"absolutely no idea\" that the song would do so well as a single, saying \"I wouldn't know how to pick a single if it hit me in the face.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Fame\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
