Brian Jones was known to Dylan and they hung out when Dylan was in London. The relationship was amicable but also tense, ending up in a car chase and car crash (without any casualties) in the middle of the night. Jones used to wear a chinese shirt at the time. Another line states that \"time was on his side\", perhaps referencing a Rolling Stones song from 1964, called 'Time is On My Side'. Pallenberg later had two children with Keith Richards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/I+Want+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
