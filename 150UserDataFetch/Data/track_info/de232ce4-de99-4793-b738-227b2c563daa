The song is written by Robbie Williams, Ashley Hamilton (son of George Hamilton), Boots Ottestad and D. Pierre. It was slightly re-mixed for single release along with newly-recorded vocals as the album version was a bit more rough-sounding in its production.\n\nThe music video was banned in most countries for being too sexually explicit. It features a hungover Robbie waking up in the morning after a large house party, as he walks around the house flashbacks of the events of the night before are shown. As the song reaches its climax, we see shots of Williams participating in three-way sex with two women (who are in fact porn stars), these shots are interspersed with graphic and unsettling images of snakes, rodents and maggots, mostly crawling on beautiful women. In the final shots, the two women have become men in drag, perhaps a subtle reference to the media's infatuation with Williams' sexuality.\n\n\"Come Undone\" became a top ten hit around the world, due to its controversial video, it was heavily censored by MTV Networks Europe for depicting a debauched (but fully-clothed) Williams having three-way sex with two women. The video also showed unsettling images of insects and reptiles, however, the uncensored version of the video was released on DVD Single in Europe and was also included on the Enhanced CD Single. BBC Radio 2 also banned the song for its explicit content. During such furores at this time, it was confirmed that Williams and Guy Chambers were to officially part ways. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Williams/_/Come+Undone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
