Finally, \"White Room\" is notable for showcasing guitarist Eric Clapton's best known use of the Vox Clyde McCoy Picture Wah (a device used to turn off bass and treble as the pedal is rocked) in the bridge and extended solo.\n\nAlong with \"Sunshine of Your Love\" and \"Crossroads\", White Room is one of Cream's most notable songs, reaching number 6 on the U.S. pop charts. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/_/White+Room\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
