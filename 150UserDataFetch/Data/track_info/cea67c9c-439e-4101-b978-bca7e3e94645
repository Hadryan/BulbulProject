Its lyrics speak of the things one may have gained and lost in life and also an autobiographical flair to it for Gilmour. Douglas Adams, a friend of Gilmour's, chose the album title from one of the lyrics in this song, the last song recorded for the album in what David Gilmour described as a \"flash of inspiration\".\n\nPink Floyd manager, Steve O'Rourke, who lobbied to be included on one of the group's albums, appears at the end with Gilmour's stepson, Charlie, who hangs up a telephone on O'Rourke.\n\nThe beginning of \"High Hopes\" is reminiscent of another of his songs, \"Fat Old Sun\", from the Pink Floyd album Atom Heart Mother. Bells chime at the beginning of both pieces, for example.\n\nThe bird sounds and fly buzzing can also be traced back to \"Grantchester Meadows\", a song from the 1969 Pink Floyd album, Ummagumma, written by Roger Waters.\n\nThis being the very last song that Pink Floyd has written to date (and its placement at the end of their last album of new material to date) lends itself to the interpretation that the song narrates the story of the band's career, from their beginnings to their grandiose success (with The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall) to their breakup to their carrying on. The final line (\"The endless river, forever and ever\") ties into one of the band's first hits, \"See Emily Play\" (\"Float on a river, forever and ever\").\n\n\"High Hopes\" was included in the 2001 compilation, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd with a shortened slide-guitar solo. The group Nightwish closes their Highest Hopes album with a cover version of this song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/High+Hopes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
