It was released as a single in the US in 1976, a decade after its initial release and six years after The Beatles split up. This was the single that was released as a promo for the Rock 'n' Roll Music compilation album. It hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, The Beatles' last top ten hit there until their 1995 release \"Free as a Bird\". A cover version by Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, produced by Paul McCartney, made the British Top 10 in the summer of 1966. Another cover version by Earth, Wind & Fire topped the US R&B charts and reached #9 on the US pop charts in 1978.\nThough officially credited to Lennon-McCartney, McCartney was primarily responsible for the writing of this track, to which he also contributes lead vocals. John Lennon was said to have been very fond of the song, saying this was, \"Paul at his best,\" according to a 1980 Playboy interview. McCartney attempted to write in the style of American soul music for this song, as particularly inspired by the Stax label. The soul revue-style horns are especially allusive to the Stax \"Memphis soul\" sound. Traces of Motown influence are apparent as well. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios between 7 April and 17 June 1966 and evolved considerably between the first takes and the final version released on album. The mono and stereo versions of the recording also feature completely different ad libs in the fade-out.\nAlthough many believed it was a love song that Paul was writing for a girl, he later disclosed the song was about marijuana in Barry Miles' book Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now. Many lyrics from the song suggested this - \"I took a ride I didn't know what I would find there / Another road where maybe I could see some other kind of mind there.\", \"What can I do, what can I be when I'm with you I want to stay there / If I am true I will never leave and if I do I know the way there.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Got+to+Get+You+Into+My+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
