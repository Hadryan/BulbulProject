The song was written to be a slower number than its upbeat final rendition. While the track was recorded in D major, the commercially released version sounds halfway between D major and E-flat major, half a semitone higher, due to Robert Smith forgetting to turn off the vari-speed on the tape after toying with it before recording. When played live, the song is played in its original intended key as opposed to the one heard on the record.\n\n\nCredits\n\nThe track was produced by both David M. Allen and The Cure, like much of the bands artwork, the single's art was designed and created by guitarist Porl Thompson and with assistance from Andy Vella.\n\n    * Robert Smith - Voice, guitar, keyboard\n    * Simon Gallup - Bass\n    * Porl Thompson - Guitar\n    * Boris Williams - Drums\n    * Perry Bamonte - Keyboard, guitar\n\n\n\nReleased - May 11, 1992\nFormat - CD, 7\" vinyl, 12\" vinyl\nGenre - Alternative rock\nLength - 3:38\nLabel - Fiction Records\nProducer - Robert Smith, David Allen <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Friday+I%27m+in+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
