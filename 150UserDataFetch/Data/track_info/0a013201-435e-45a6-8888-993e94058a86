Meanwhile, after McKinven and Anderson left to be replaced by multi-instrumentalist Steve Lironi (who had left Restricted Code) they began to work with pop producer Mike Chapman, providing them with another hit, \"Don't Talk To Me About Love\", one of their most well-known songs. It peaked at #7 in the UK, one of their highest positions, and is consistently included on many 1980s retrospective collections in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Altered+Images/_/I+Could+Be+Happy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
