It is also available on their third album There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The song is particularly unique among the band's work because of Dave Grohl's implementation of the talk box in parts of the song. The usage of the device was partly inspired by Grohl's admiration of Peter Frampton and Joe Walsh, both of whom helped popularise it in the 1970s. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Generator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Generator\" is a Foo Fighters song, released as a single in 2000 in Australia only and also released as a limited edition single of 20,000 copies only in Europe.

Dave Grohl has said that the song reminds him of his arrest on the Gold Coast, Australia.\n\nNo video was filmed for the single instead the group overdubbed a live performance of the song with the studio version to promote the single and album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Generator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
