It went somewhere I didn't expect it to go, and that became a direction to look in.\"\n\nJones told Rolling Stone that unlike previous albums, she wrote the songs for The Fall including this one on an acoustic guitar instead of a piano. \"It just felt more natural for me to play it on these songs,\" Jones explained: \"I knew I wanted to play with grooves more than I have on previous albums. Some of these new songs lent themselves to having driving rhythms underneath.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Norah+Jones/_/Chasing+Pirates\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
