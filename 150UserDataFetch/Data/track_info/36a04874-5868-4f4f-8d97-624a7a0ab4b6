It was, however, a surprise hit in Australia, reaching #5 and initiating a string of five consecutive Top 20 hits. In the U.S, the song's popularity has only climbed steadily since 1986 and it is considered a classic in many circles.\n\nIn 2004 the song was ranked #201 in Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\nThe 12-inch version appears on the compilation Substance and a remix by Stephen Hague features on their Best Of album.\n\nThe music video was directed by American artist Robert Longo. It prominently featured shots of a man and a woman in business suits flying through the air as though propelled by trampolines; this is based directly on Longo's \"Men in the Cities\" series of lithographs.\n\nThe single mix features a cleaner sound with more electronics than the album version, notably the Fairlight CMI music workstation, the premier sampling keyboard workstation of the eighties, used to provide novel sounds, such as the orchestral hits that were so popular, but also to sequence the song. All instruments minus bass and voice were sequenced.[3]\n\nA version is on the soundtrack of the 1988 film Married to the Mob. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order/_/Bizarre+Love+Triangle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
