Could you define the word \"Paranoiac\" ...? \n\nThe Paranoiac-critical method is a surrealist technique developed by Salvador Dalí. The Surrealists related theories of psychology to the idea of creativity and the production of art. André Breton wrote about a fundamental crisis of the object. The object began being thought of not as a fixed external object but also as an extension of our subjective self. One of the types of objects manifested in Surrealism was the phantom object.\n\nThe aspect of paranoia that Dalí was interested in and which helped inspire the method was the ability of the brain to perceive links between things which rationally are not linked. Dalí described the paranoiac-critical method as a spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the critical and systematic objectivity of the associations and interpretations of delirious phenomena.\n\nEmploying the method when creating a work of art uses an active process of the mind to visualise images in the work and incorporate these into the final product. An example of the resulting work is a double image or multiple image in which an ambiguous image can be interpreted in different ways.\nAndré Breton hailed the method, saying that Dalí's paranoiac-critical method was an \"instrument of primary importance\" and that it \"has immediately shown itself capable of being applied equally to painting, poetry, the cinema, the construction of typical Surrealist objects, fashion, sculpture, the history of art, and even, if necessary, all manner of exegesis.\"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Younger+Brother/_/All+I+Want\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
