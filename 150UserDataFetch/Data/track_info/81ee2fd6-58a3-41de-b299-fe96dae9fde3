After Dylan wrote it, he produced a demo in December 1964, which The Byrds' version is based on. Dylan's recording of the song is placed at #106 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[1] Due to The Byrds' version of the song also making the list at #79, it is one of three songs to place twice, along with \"Walk This Way\" by both Aerosmith and Run-DMC with Perry and Tyler, and \"Blue Suede Shoes\" by both Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley.[2]\n\nTwo earlier recordings by Dylan of the song, one live at New York's Philharmonic Hall dating from October 31, 1964, and one recorded with Ramblin' Jack Elliott on backing vocals during sessions for Another Side of Bob Dylan (also 1964), have recently been given official releases; they are available on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall (2004) and The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home (2005) respectively. Videos of this song with Bob Dylan singing and playing it at the Newport Folk Festival of 1964 can be seen on No Direction Home, a documentary film by Martin Scorsese, and Murray Lerner's The Other Side Of The Mirror.\n\nStructurally, the song is notable for the fact that it begins with an iteration of the chorus, rather than following the conventional pop song structure, which typically employs a brief instrumental introduction that leads into the first verse.\n\nThe song (in its complete version) has invoked many theories about its meaning and theme. Due to the high rating and placement in the top 10 Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, it could be considered one of Dylan's most evocative and poetic songs.\n\nBruce Langhorne, the Greenwich Village folk guitarist, may well have been an inspiration for the song by way of the giant Turkish tambourine-like frame drum he was often known to play in the time leading up to the song's composition;[3][4] he also recorded using the instrument with Richard and Mimi Fariña. The electric guitar accompaniment on the album version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" is among Langhorne's numerous credits on Bob Dylan's recordings. There are also other influences on the song. Dylan himself has cited Federico Fellini's movie La strada and the words \"in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you\" are taken from a Lord Buckley recording.[5]\n\nOn the master recording, Dylan is playing an acoustic guitar in dropped D tuning, capoed at the third fret. An electric guitar plays a counter melody to back up Dylan's vocals.\n\nDylan's master recording clocks at 5' 28\" and consists of four verses, while The Byrds' version used only the second verse and was two-and-a-half minutes long.\n\n    * Judy Collins covered the song on her Fifth Album (1965).\n    * Chad and Jeremy covered the song on their fifth album I Don't Want To Lose You Baby (1965).\n    * Kenny Rankin covered the song on his Mind-Dusters album (1967).\n    * Melanie Safka covered the song on her 1969 album Born to Be (aka My First Album).\n    * Gene Clark covered the song on his Firebyrd album (1984).\n    * Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson requested the song be played at his funeral while his ashes were shot out of a cannon and also dedicated Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to Dylan because of the song.\n\n    * Neil Aspinall, The Beatles' road manager and personal assistant, also had this song played by Pete Townshend at his funeral.\n\n    * William Shatner covered the song in a spoken-word recitation on his 1968 album, The Transformed Man.\n\n    * Les Fradkin covered the song on his CD \"12\" and as part of the \"Timeless Flyte\" tribute series.\n\n    * Former American Idol contestant Jason Castro covered this song on the show in 2008, forgetting one line of the lyrics. He later mentioned in an interview that, \"Someone told me I Shot the Tambourine Man;\" a reference to him also singing \"I Shot the Sheriff\" by Bob Marley that same week.\n\n    * The song was translated and sung in Russian by Olga Arefieva as Mister Beliy Grib.\n\n    * Genki Sudo translated the song along with ACIDMAN and performed the song on his CD Single, Love and Everything, while keeping 'Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me' in English.\n\n    * Müslüm Gürses has covered the song with different lyrics written in Turkish. The Turkish version of the song was called Hayat Berbat (Life is Awful).\n\n    * Mr Tambourine Man is used in the closing credits of the Christmas Special episode of the British TV comedy series One Foot in the Grave called 'Starbound'.\n\n    * They Might Be Giants wrote their rare song \"Weep Day\" after seeing this song's title overlapping the end of a line, inspiring the song about two characters named Mr. Tambo and Urine Man. The band has also been known to cover the song live at concerts.\n\n    * In Tom Wolfe's non-fiction novel The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Mr. Tambourine Man is mentioned numerous times about Dylan's \"raunching and rheuming\".\n\n    * Many indie bands have also covered this song, notably the Cincinnati experimental group Nevada Smith. The Minneapolis band Cloud Cult has also covered the song.\n\n    * It is one of several Dylan songs studied by the students in Dangerous Minds, where it is suggested that the title character is a drug dealer.\n\n    * It was translated into Romanian by Florian Pittiş and sung by Pasărea Colibri on their 1995 album \"În căutarea cuibului pierdut\".\n\n    * In Stephen King's book Carrie the song is mentioned amongst others as the Entretainment portion of the famous Prom Scene alongside 500 Miles, Cabaret and Lemon Tree\n\n    * A famous scene from BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave sees lead character Victor Meldrew played by Richard Wilson riding a motorised lawn mower whilst [unknowingly] under the influence of drugs singing Hey Mr Tambourine Man. He proceeds to drive into his employers dining room where his employer is in the middle of a meeting with several people including his former neighbour Patrick. He manages to give the carpet a good trim and then drives straight into his employers summer house.\n\n    * In the October, 1992 Bob Dylan 30th anniversary tribute concert at Madison Square Garden, Mr. Tambourine Man was performed by The Byrds' founder Roger McGuinn, backed by Tom Petty, Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench, among others. The tribute used an arrangement similar to The Byrds' 1965 recording, with one additional verse.\n\n    * Bob Sinclar covered the song on his 2009 album titled Born In 69\n\n    * The Barbarians\n\n# ^ \"The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time #101 through #200\".
