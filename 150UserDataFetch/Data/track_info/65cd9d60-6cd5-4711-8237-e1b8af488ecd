The track also went to number 1 in Ireland on 18 July 1966. In America, it peaked at number fourteen. \"Sunny Afternoon\" was placed at #200 on Pitchfork Media's list of The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s.\n\nThe promotional video for the single ironically featured the band performing in a cold, snowy environment.\n\nThe song has been covered a number of performers, including by the Stereophonics on their live DVD, Live at Morfa Stadium, by former Space singer Tommy Scott on Reload, by Jimmy Buffett on his 1994 album Fruitcakes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks/_/Sunny+Afternoon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
