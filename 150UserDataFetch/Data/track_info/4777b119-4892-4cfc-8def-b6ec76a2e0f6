Written to bring attention to the problem of homelessness, the song was a substantial departure from the dance-pop music of his previous album, No Jacket Required (1985). The song was a number-one hit around the world, and his most successful song. It eventually won Collins and producer Hugh Padgham the 1991 Grammy Award for Record of the Year.

The song was a number-one hit around the world, and his most successful song. It eventually won Collins and producer Hugh Padgham the 1991 Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The song also won Best British Single at the 1990 Brit Awards.\n\nCollins's version was listed at #86 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time.\n\nThe song was another huge hit for Collins. On December 23, 1989, it became Collins's seventh (and to date, final) number-one single in the United States. The song was also the final number-one song of the 1980s in the U.S., and remained at number-one for four weeks, which sometimes classifies the song as a hit from the 1990s as well. It also saw out the 1980s and saw in the 1990s at the top of the German singles chart. The song had already reached number two in the UK in November of that year. The single version is slightly different from the album version in that it uses a shorter intro. David Crosby also appears on the backing vocals. The track is also recorded using a tuning that is approximately two-thirds of a quarter tone sharp of the standard A440.\n\nListeners to BBC Radio 1's breakfast show, hosted by Simon Mayo, voted for the Phil Collins original as the Best Single at the 1990 BRIT Awards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins/_/Another+Day+in+Paradise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
