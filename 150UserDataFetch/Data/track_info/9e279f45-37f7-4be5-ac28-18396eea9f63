The Girl from Ipanema  Songfacts explains that Jobim and Moraes were inspired by Helo Pinheiro, a young Brazilian girl who wore a bikini and regularly walked \"Like a samba\" past the \"Veloso\" bar that they frequented.\n\nThe first commercial recording was in 1962, by Pery Ribeiro. The version performed by Astrud Gilberto, along with João Gilberto and Stan Getz, from the 1963 album Getz/Gilberto, became an international hit, reaching #5 in the U.S., #29 in the UK, and charting highly throughout the world. Numerous recordings have been used in movies, sometimes as an elevator music cliché (for example, near the end of The Blues Brothers).\n\nIn 2004, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n\nAlthough Astrud Gilberto's original version was \"The Girl from Ipanema\", when covered by other female artists the song has often been rendered as \"The Boy from Ipanema\", with gender-specific lyrics. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Astrud+Gilberto/_/The+Girl+From+Ipanema\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
