Elfman also composed the score for the film. The track also appears on the Siouxsie & the Banshees compilation album Twice Upon a Time: The Singles.\n\nIn the Melody Maker, the Stud Brothers wrote : \"it's a slow, heavily orchestral & sensuously tense piece with Siouxsie first tapt, then cracked and finally spiralling off into the ether\".\n\nThe song features strings which build to a dramatic conclusion. Thanks to Danny Elfman's involvement the song features elements from his score to the film. Lyrically the song makes indirect references to Batman Returns characters Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle. \"Face to Face\" is heard in the film during a ballroom scene in which the characters are dancing together, not realizing that, as their alter-egos (Batman and Catwoman), they are enemies. The lyrics reflect the characters' conflict (\"...Cheek to cheek / the bitter sweet / commit your crime / in your deadly time / It's too divine / I want to bend / I want this bliss / but something says I must resist...\"). At one point Siouxsie can be heard purring like a cat, a reference to Catwoman.\n\n\"Face to Face\" peaked at number twenty-one in the UK singles chart. It also performed well on American alternative rock radio, where the single peaked at number seven on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. Remixes of \"Face to Face\" were produced by 808 State. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees/_/Face+to+Face\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
