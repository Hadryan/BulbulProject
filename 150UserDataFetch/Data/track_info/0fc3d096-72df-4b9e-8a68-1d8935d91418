The song is reminiscent of Supremes singles and other classic girl group songs and was chiefly penned by Geri Halliwell, although as with all their songs the other girls had a great deal of input. Though not the last single to include Geri Halliwell's vocals, it was the last single to be released before her departure.\n\nChart performance\n\nThis single is seen as the group's second least successful single ever in terms of chart performance and worldwide sales. It only managed to peak at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100, two positions higher than \"Spice Up Your Life\", but dropped out of the top fifty much quicker, making it the pieces of Spice's least successful United States release.\n\nIn the UK, \"Stop\" ended the run of the pieces of the Spice Girls' consecutive #1 songs, at six (from \"Wannabe\" to \"Too Much\"), but still allowed them to become the first act in history to have their first six singles make number 1 in the UK. This record was eventually overtaken by Westlife, whose first 7 singles went to number 1 in the UK. The song debuted at #2, being kept off the top spot by the million-selling Jason Nevins remix of Run DMC's 1983 hit \"It's Like That\",\n\nMusic video\n \nSpice Girls in \"Stop\"The first section including the knocking on the door scenes at the beginning were shot on Carnew Street (a street also used for scenes in Angela's Ashes, The Bogwoman and Michael Collins) in Dublin. The second half of the video for \"Stop\" is set in the small town of Carrickmacross, Co. Monaghan in Ireland, in around the late 1950s or early 1960s, with the girls running around the streets dancing, jump roping, hula hooping, and participating in competitions of various kinds. At the end, they all sing on stage at a bar.\n\nDuring the song's chorus, the video shows the girls performing a simple \"hand-action\" dance, which was often performed along to the song by Spice Girls fans.\n\nLive performances\n\n\"Stop\" was a popular number on the group's concerts, featuring a \"false intro\" after which they showed the acrobatic skills of their male dancers, and then they did begin the song. After Geri left, her parts were taken over by Mel B.\n\nThe girls performed the song for Children In Need and the Victoria's Secret fashion show on 16 November 2007 in Los Angeles.[2] It was their first performance as a quintet in 9 years. The Victoria's Secret performance aired 4 December 2007 on CBS.\n\nThe introduction of the song on the reunion concerts is the first verse of \"It's Like That\" by Run DMC, the song that reached the number one instead of Stop in 1998, breaking the Spice Girls' tradition of having all the singles going to number one.\n\nStop was performed at The 1998 Brit Awards, where the girls emgered on a vintage car.\n\n\n\"Stop to the Top\"\n\nLong before the announcement of the Spice Girls' reunion in February 2007, fans from the UK set up a MySpace page to start a campaign to get \"Stop\" to the number 1 spot in the UK charts, being, at the time, the only single the Girls never got into the top position. Since there was no actual CD release, from 2 July to 7 July, fans had to purchase the song from the main online stores. Without the help from any big media, the song charted at number 78 peaking at 53 on the mid-week charts (on 2 July), still a big accomplishment from a single released almost a decade prior. The campaign achieved 1,952 downloads between 2 July to 7 July, and managed to reach the Top 10 of many UK store charts and number 1 on the Tesco downloads charts.\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Spice+Girls/_/Stop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
