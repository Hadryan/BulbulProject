The group largely wrote the song during recording sessions in Southern France in 1987. The lyrics were written by the band's frontman Robert Smith, who drew inspiration from a past trip to the sea shore with his future wife. Before Smith had completed the lyrics an instrumental version of the song was used as the theme for the French television show Les Enfants du Rock.\n\n\"Just Like Heaven\" was the third single released from the band's 1987 album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, while Smith's memories of the trip formed the basis for the song's accompanying music video. The song became The Cure's first American hit and in 1988 reached number 40 on the Billboard charts. It has been highly praised by critics and covered by artists such as Dinosaur Jr and Katie Melua. Smith has said he considers \"Just Like Heaven\" to be one of the band's strongest songs.\n\n\nBackground and recording\n\nIn order to develop material for Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Robert Smith forced himself to write music for 15 days of each month. During this regimen, he developed the chords and melody which form the basis of \"Just Like Heaven\". Structurally, Smith found what he had written was similar to The Only Ones's 1979 hit \"Another Girl, Another Planet\". When he brought an instrumental demo of the song to the album recording sessions in Southern France, Cure drummer Boris Williams increased the tempo and added an opening drum fill which inspired Smith to introduce each instrument singularly and in sequence.\n\nWhen the French TV show Les Enfants du Rock asked The Cure to provide a theme song Smith offered the instrumental version. As he explained, \"it meant the music would be familiar to millions of Europeans even before it was released\". He completed the lyrics when the group moved the sessions to Studio Miraval, located in Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur. The band completed the song quickly, and at the time Smith considered it to be the most obvious potential single from the songs the band had recorded during their two week stay at Miraval.\n\nB-side - \"Snow in Summer\"/\"Breathe\"/\"Sugar Girl\"/\"A Chain of Flowers\"\nReleased - 5 October 1987\nFormat - 7\", 12\", CD\nRecorded - Studio Miraval, France, 1987\nGenre - Alternative rock\nLength - 3:32\nLabel - Fiction\nWriter(s) - Robert Smith, Simon Gallup, Porl Thompson, Boris Williams, Lol Tolhurst\nProducer - David M.
