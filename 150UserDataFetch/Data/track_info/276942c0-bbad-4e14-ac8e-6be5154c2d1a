The single includes a previously unreleased track \"There's Never Enough Time\" and two cover tracks by The Shins and Iron & Wine of \"We Will Become Silhouettes\" and \"Such Great Heights\", respectively.\n\nThe tracks were recorded in early 2002, and were written by Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello, and included backing vocals in the studio recording by Jen Wood, whose other collaborations include work for The Black Heart Procession and Joan of Arc. It was the first CD released by The Postal Service, and a preview of Give Up, which was released a month later. The cover artwork was designed by Kozyndan.\n\nThe title song \"Such Great Heights\" has exhibited unusual staying power. It has consistently been one of the weekly top 5 most frequently played tracks on social music site Last.fm since the website began, holding the top spot for the majority of 2005. The song's reign in the top 10 ended in March 2007, when after the release of the Arcade Fire album, Neon Bible, the song did not make it as the top 10 was predominantly songs from Neon Bible. The song was featured on a 2004 episode of Veronica Mars. It has also been used in several television commercials, for organizations such as Ask.com, Kaiser Permanente, Target, UPS and M&M's. The song was also featured in the trailer for the 2004 film Garden State and the Iron & Wine cover version was featured in the film and its soundtrack. An instrumental version of the song is currently featured as part of UPS's \"Whiteboard\" ad campaign, which was launched 6 January 2007, almost four years after the song was officially released. The song was used in Grey's Anatomy, and appears on its season one soundtrack, Grey's Anatomy Original Soundtrack Volume 1. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Postal+Service/_/Such+Great+Heights\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
