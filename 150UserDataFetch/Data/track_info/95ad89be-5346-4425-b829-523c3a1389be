Like most of the other singles released from Pop, the \"Single  Version\" (If God Will Send His Angels) is different to the album version, quite noticeably so in places as well. The 'Single Version' was also included on the soundtrack for the film \"City of Angels\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/If+God+Will+Send+His+Angels\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"If God Will Send His Angels\", the 4th track on the 1997 album Pop, is a ballad with an off-beat sound, that continues the albums experimental theme, at the same time; it is also the first break from the opening triple salvo of heavy, big-beat tracks.
