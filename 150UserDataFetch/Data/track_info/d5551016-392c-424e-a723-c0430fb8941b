The original lyrics, which dealt with sex, were penned by Dave Mustaine. However, much like the events surrounding \"The Four Horsemen,\" new lyrics were written by James Hetfield upon Mustaine's departure from Metallica. These new lyrics revolve around people being damned to Hell and therefore \"jumping in the fire.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Jump+in+the+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
