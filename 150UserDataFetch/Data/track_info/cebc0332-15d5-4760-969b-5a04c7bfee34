A live version of the song also reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977, peaking at #38.\n\nIt is used as a finale by Lynyrd Skynyrd during their live performances, and it is their longest song.\n\nThe lyrical portion of the song was written early in the group's history. Roadie Billy Powell was discovered as a keyboardist for the band when he played the intro piece to \"Free Bird\" at a high school prom. Lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant noted his talent and invited him to join.\n\n\"If I leave here tomorrow would you still remember me?\" was asked of Allen Collins by his girlfriend. Collins jotted the question down and it eventually became the opening line of \"Free Bird\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd/_/Free+Bird\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
