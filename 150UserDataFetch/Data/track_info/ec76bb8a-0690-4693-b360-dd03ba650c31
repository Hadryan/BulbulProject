The song was written entirely by keyboardist Kevin Moore, and mainly consists of a dark, brooding duet between Moore playing the piano, and vocalist James LaBrie, until the rest of the band kick in for a dramatic outro, fading out until Moore ends the song with the piano passage that opened the song.\n\nThe song is notable for never being played live by the band until 2014 when they performed it during their \"Along for the Ride\" tour, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the album. Kevin Moore left Dream Theater after the song was included on the album. Some members of the band have expressed that they were not willing to perform it without Moore, due them seeing it as 'Moore's song'. Jordan Rudess, however, in a later interview stated that he wanted to play it live whenever the rest of the band were ready.\n\nThe demo of this song had Kevin on vocals.\n\nHere's what Kevin Moore told a Japanese interviewer about the song:\n\n    \"It was inspired by... I was looking through a clothing catalog and saw a picture of a girl modeling this piece of clothing called a space-dye vest. And, so, I fell in love with her [laughs] for some strange reason & so the minute I did that, the minute I was just like obsessed with this person, I was like, 'why am I doing that?' & I noticed that I was doing it a lot lately. And I think the prime reason that I was doing that, and this is what I figured out at the time, was that I had just come out of a relationship where I'd gotten dumped, basically, and so I think the situation was that I wasn't finished giving all that I was ready to give, so I was just, like, throwing it around, you know, just aiming it in different directions. It was a total case of projection. And this song is just trying to sort it out & just kind of admitting that I'm just kind of lost. So it's kind of a dark song. It was very cathartic though.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/_/Space-Dye+Vest\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
