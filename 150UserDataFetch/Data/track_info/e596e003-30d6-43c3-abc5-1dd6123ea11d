During early shows former lead guitarist, Mustaine, said that it was their version of a love song. This is the only song in the history of the band that is credited to Hetfield alone, one of two in which Ulrich doesn't have a credit (both on this album, the other is \"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth\"). At 3:08, it is the shortest original Metallica recording. (Only certain cover songs recorded by the band are shorter.)\n\n\"Motorbreath\" is featured on the soundtrack to the game MTX: Mototrax. During the film Any Given Sunday the song can be heard playing in the locker room after one of the Miami Sharks' victories.\n\nThe song was covered a couple of times, most notably by Canadian punk band D.O.A. on the \"Punk Tribute to Metallica\"-Sampler and in 2004 by Scott Ian and Page Hamilton.\n\nThe song \"Love is a Danger Zone 2\" in the Pump It Up series of rhythm dance video games is inspired by \"Motorbreath.\"\n\nThe song was covered by Anacrusis on some of their early recorded rehearsals and is available for download on their website. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Motorbreath\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
