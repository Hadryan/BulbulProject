It was first performed in 1971 by Ronnie Spector and released as a single. George Harrison included the song on his 1973 album Living in the Material World.\n\n\"Try Some, Buy Some\" is \"an all-time favourite\" of English singer David Bowie. He covered the song on his 2003 album Reality. Bowie had originally intended to record it for a planned follow-up to Pin Ups, his 1973 collection of cover versions. Talking to Rolling Stone shortly before the release of Reality, he said of his recording: \"We were pretty true to the original arrangement, but the overall atmosphere is somewhat different. It's a dense piece.\"\n\nBowie occasionally performed \"Try Some, Buy Some\" live on his 2003â€“04 Reality Tour. In a review for the limited-edition box set David Bowie Box (2007), critic Thom Jurek described Reality as a \"schizophrenic recording\", on which the covers of \"Try Some, Buy Some\" and the Modern Lovers song \"Pablo Picasso\" \"(distinguish) this set more than anything else\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Try+Some,+Buy+Some\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
