It was the first single from their second album, Siamese Dream, and was written by lead vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan. It was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal at the Grammy Awards of 1994, their first Grammy nomination along with a Best Alternative Music Performance nomination for Siamese Dream.\n\nThe song was a moderate success for the band, being performed on Saturday Night Live and making it to the Triple J Hottest 100 at number 43. Readers ranked Cherub Rock at number 97 in Guitar World's list of the 100 greatest guitar solos of all time. In June 2008 a readers' poll in Rolling Stone magazine, Cherub Rock was listed as the 25th greatest guitar track of all time. In March 2005, Q magazine placed it at number 67 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In October 2005, the Fox Broadcasting Company used \"Cherub Rock\" to advertise their Major League Baseball postseason coverage. Also for some time, professional wrestler Psicosis used \"Cherub Rock\" as his entrance theme. The song also appears in the video games Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Rock Band. \n\nCherub Rock was one of the last songs written for the album, and the lyrics relate to Corgan's relationship with his perception of the indie-rock community and larger media. The song was performed in standard tuning with a G sharp octave played at the 11th fret, which the band used on other songs, such as \"Drown\" and \"Starla\". Apparently this caused many to bring other bands using the same chord to Corgan's attention as \"sounding like The Smashing Pumpkins\". The prominent effect on the solo was achieved by recording the guitar solo to two different tapes which were then run simultaneously, with the speed of one tape slightly altered. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smashing+Pumpkins/_/Cherub+Rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
