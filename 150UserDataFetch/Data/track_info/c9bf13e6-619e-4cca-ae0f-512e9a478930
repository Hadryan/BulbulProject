In the United States the song reached the top position of the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1985, due in no small part to the wide exposure of its memorable and cutting-edge music video on MTV; directed by Steve Barron, the video features the band in a pencil-sketch animation/live-action combination called rotoscoping. The video won six awards, and was nominated for two others at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/a-ha/_/Take+on+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
