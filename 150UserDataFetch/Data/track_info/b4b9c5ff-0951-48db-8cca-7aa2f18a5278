The lyrics relate the pitfalls of being a celebrity. The song starts with a faded-in synth line and quickly starts the main tune. The easy groove is achieved with a smooth bass guitar and piano embellishments. A drum machine provides handclaps to make the song danceable. \"Pop Life\" was recorded before Purple Rain was even completed, indicating the new direction Prince wanted to take after the movie hype. Drums on the song were played by Sheila E., and Wendy and Lisa provide backing vocals. The rest of the song was performed by Prince. The single reached #7 in the U.S.\n\nUnlike many Prince hits, he did not create a video for this song.\n\nThe song was released in two extended versions.

The U.S. received a \"Fresh Dance Mix\", which is a remix (by Sheila E.) that included some portions of the longer UK version. It clocks in at 6:16, and was included on the 2006 compilation album, Ultimate.\n\nThe U.S. B-side of the track was \"Hello\", written quickly as a response to those who criticized Prince's lack of participation in the \"We Are the World\" event. The angry lyrics lambaste the prying media and false friendships, and is driven by a pulsing beat. The extended version of the song ends with a spoken word by Prince, which contain some self-humor about his high-heeled shoes. The UK B-side was \"Girl\", which the U.S. had as the B-side of \"America\".\n\nElvis Costello once planned to do a cover version of the song, with altered lyrics, but Prince refused <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Pop+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
