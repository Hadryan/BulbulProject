It also appears on the Burnout Paradise soundtrack and most recently the Soundwave 2009 compilation, to promote their appearance at said festival in Australia. It was covered by Opeth, on their single \"Burden\", a song off their 2008 album Watershed.\n\nJerry Cantrell commented about the song,\n“I was thinking a lot about Andrew Wood at the time. We always had a great time when we did hang out, much like Chris Cornell and I do. There was never really a serious moment or conversation, it was all fun. Andy was a hilarious guy, full of life and it was really sad to lose him. But I always hate people who judge the decisions others make. So it was also directed towards people who pass judgments.\t”  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains/_/Would%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
