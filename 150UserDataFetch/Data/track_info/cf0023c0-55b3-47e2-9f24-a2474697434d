(Though omitted from the aired performance, the song was included in the Unplugged CD and DVD release, and on the Greatest Hits disc and 'Music Bank box set.\n\nJerry Cantrell on the song, from the liner notes of 1999's Music Bank box set collection:\n\n\"Such a brilliant song. I'm very proud of Layne for writing it. When I've stepped up vocally in the past he's been so supportive, and here was a fine example of him stepping up with the guitar and writing a masterpiece.\"\n\n\"Angry Chair\" was released as a single in 1992. \"Angry Chair\" peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at number 27 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The UK single was released in May 1993. \"Angry Chair\" reached the top 40 in the UK and the top 30 in Ireland.\n\nNed Raggett of Allmusic said that \"Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell unsurprisingly are the ones who transform the song into something really spectacular\" and added that the song features \"entrancing verses, ominous, echo-swathed and charged with a looming destruction.\n\nAlthough Dirt marked the introduction of Staley's guitar playing contributions to the group, he rarely played in concert, focusing instead on his vocals and showmanship. This is one of the few songs he regularly played guitar on during live performances.\n\nThe ending to the song was often used as a lead in to another famous Alice in Chains song \"Man in the Box\" in concert.\n\nThe current members of AIC performed an acoustic version of \"Angry Chair\" with Stone Temple Pilots/ex-Velvet Revolver lead singer Scott Weiland in concert on September 30, 2007 in Austin, TX.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains/_/Angry+Chair\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
