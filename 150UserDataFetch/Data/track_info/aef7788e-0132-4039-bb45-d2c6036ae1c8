It is his most successful and recognisable song—a remake of Mano Negra's song, \"King of Bongo\" (1991), which has its roots from a 1939 recording of \"King of the Bongo Bong\" by the trumpeter, Roy Eldridge. It also uses the background music from Black Uhuru's song \"Bull ina di Pen\" from their \"Anthem\" album. It is part of a medley with \"Je Ne T'Aime Plus\" on the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Manu+Chao/_/Bongo+Bong\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Bongo Bong\" is the first solo single by Manu Chao from his first album, Clandestino.

The music has been reused for other songs such as \"Mr. Bobby\" which was first released on this single before being re-recorded for his second album and \"Homens\" from the same album.\n\nIn 2006, a cover version by Robbie Williams, combining \"Bongo Bong\" and \"Je Ne T'Aime Plus\" in one track, was published on Williams' album Rudebox. The version got a single release of its own in 2007. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Manu+Chao/_/Bongo+Bong\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
