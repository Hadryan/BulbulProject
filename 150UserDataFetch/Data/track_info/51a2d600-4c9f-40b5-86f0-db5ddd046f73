It turned into \"Trembling Hands,\" one of the first songs finished for the second album and their most heartfelt song to date. \n\"I always thought it had a Coldplay tinge to it,'' Mandagi says. \"Coldplay slash Snow Patrol. Which is not a bad thing..\" However inside whispers suggested \"Trembling Hands\" was \"too Coldplay\" for Mandagi's liking, especially when it started being mentioned as their comeback single. \n\"We were tossing up between \"Need Your Love\" or \"Trembling Hands.\" \n\"If I played it to a few friends, they liked it, they said it sounds like Coldplay. My worry was I didn't want to come back after a year and a half with a song that sounds like Coldplay as the first single. Even if people don't like \"Need Your Love\" at least it sounds like us. \"  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Temper+Trap/_/Trembling+Hands\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
