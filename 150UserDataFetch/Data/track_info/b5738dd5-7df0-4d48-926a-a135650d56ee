The followup single, \"Tunnel of Love\", also reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, giving Springsteen two consecutive #1's. The single had less commercial success in other countries.\n\nLike much of the Tunnel of Love album, \"Brilliant Disguise\" was recorded in Springsteen's home studio, called Thrill Hill East, between January and May of 1987 with several members of the E Street Band. On this song, Springsteen played several instruments and is backed by Roy Bittan on keyboards, Danny Federici on organ and Max Weinberg on drums.\n\nSpringsteen himself wrote about the song \"after '85 I'd had enough and turned inward to write about men, women and love, things that have previously been on the periphery of my work.\"\n\nThe song was later released on the compilation album The Essential Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\nThe version currently playing on Last.fm is a cover by an unknown artist. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Brilliant+Disguise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
