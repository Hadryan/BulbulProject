It was released on The Wall album in 1979.\n\nThe song switches from a quiet dynamic to a louder one, expanding its instrumentation from acoustic guitar and solo voice to include (by the song's end) reed organ, piano, drums, electric bass, vocal harmony, and electric guitar. At five minutes, 35 seconds in length, the song has a minimal introduction, consisting only of sharp inhalation and rapid exhalation before the first verses are sung by Roger Waters. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Mother\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Mother is a song by the British progressive rock band Pink Floyd.

At five minutes, 35 seconds in length, the song has a minimal introduction, consisting only of sharp inhalation and rapid exhalation before the first verses are sung by Roger Waters. David Gilmour sings a chorus in narrative response to the first set of lyrics and an instrumental interlude follows. Waters sings another verse, which is once more followed by Gilmour's chorus (with altered lyrics). Finally, the song concludes with a suddenly stripped-down arrangement and a ritardando in which Waters sings, \"Mother did it need to be so high?\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Mother\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
