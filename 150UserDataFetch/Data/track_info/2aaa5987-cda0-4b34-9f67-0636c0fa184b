It was released as the third single from their debut album Definitely Maybe on 8 August 1994, just prior to that album's release.\n\nGallagher wrote the song in 1991, before he joined Oasis. Inspired by The Rolling Stones' \"Shine a Light,\" \"Live Forever\" features a basic song structure and lyrics with an optimistic outlook that contrasted with the attitude of the grunge bands popular at the time. The song was the first Oasis single to enter the top ten in the United Kingdom, and garnered critical acclaim.\n\nThis song is about Gallagher's optimistic view on life, contrasting himself and Kurt Cobain. The main difference, as Noel Gallagher stated;  “here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, ‘cause you didn’t know where you’d end up at night.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDOM8Xzjp_E <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Live+Forever\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
