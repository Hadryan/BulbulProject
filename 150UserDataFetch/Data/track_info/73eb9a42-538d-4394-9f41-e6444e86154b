It was released 13 November 1995 as the second single from that album, charting at #5 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe song has been used on TV advertisements for British Gas since 2009 (although it never re-entered the top 40). \n\nIn keeping with the song's science fiction theme, the single's cover art is an allusion to the opening shot of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the music video is a tribute to the movie A Clockwork Orange, with the band dressed up in costumes similar to Alex and his droogs. Both movies were directed by Stanley Kubrick.\n\nThe song has increased in stature since its release; this is proved by it being voted second best of all Blur singles on blurtalk.com's Singles Vote. In addition, on Rate Your Music the song is often in the Top 25 for 1995 as well as being in the Top 500 of all time.\n\nThe highly-acclaimed music video for the song was directed by Jonathan Glazer. The band is presented in imitation of the opening scenes from the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, in the milk bar. Blur star as the quasi-Droogs, complete with Damon Albarn wearing eyeliner similar to the film. They perform in the bar in all-white.\n\nThe bar patrons consist of different groups; a lone female entertains male business colleagues by exploiting their sexual interest in her; two odd men entirely coloured red and blue conduct a stilted (subtitled) conversation; and two male colleagues – one of them in a priest in a vicar's dog collar – become increasingly drunk on cocktails, laughing more and more hysterically until a final shock moment which eventually leads us to seeing the priest planting a kiss on him at the last second of the video.\n\nThe golf ball-shaped speaker featured in the video was sold in a charity auction in 1999. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/_/The+Universal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
