In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #435 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nRecording on \"Beast of Burden\" began in October of 1977 and ended in December of that same year. Although written before entering the studio, many of the lyrics were improvised by Jagger to fit with the smooth running guitars of Richards and Wood. Note the rolling, fluid licks traded off by the two. Neither is really playing lead or rhythm; they both slip in and out, one playing high while the other is low. The song is another of the famed Some Girls songs which feature each member of the band playing their respective instruments without any outside performers; both Richards and Wood play acoustic and electric guitars, with Wood performing the solo.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Beast+of+Burden\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
