Lead vocals were performed by Graham Gouldman.\n\nThe lyrics, about a white man lost in Jamaica, were based on a true story told by Moody Blues vocalist Justin Hayward about an experience he had had in Barbados; it was a rare excursion into reggae for the act. It became the act's third and final number one single in the UK, and final top 10 hit, spending a single week at the top in September 1978. The single peaked at #44 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the USA. The song was later covered by Boney M on their 1985 album, Eye Dance. A remade version using some of the lyrics, was released by the Eurodisco group French Connection under the title 'I don't like reggae' in 1993. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/10cc/_/Dreadlock+Holiday\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
