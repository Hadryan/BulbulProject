It also has a popular music video featuring Sting taking a trip through the desert in a Jaguar S-Type and then going to a nightclub to perform the song with Cheb Mami. After shooting the video, Sting's manager Miles Copeland III approached Jaguar about a collaboration, and the auto company featured the video in their prominent television advertisements during the year 2000.\n\nAlso included on the single releases were club remixes by Victor Calderone. One remixed version of the song was used in an alternative edit of the video, which included more sexually explicit footage. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sting/_/Desert+Rose\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
