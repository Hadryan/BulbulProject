The song is driven by a rapid guitar riff by John Frusciante, and makes use of double stops on the bass by Flea.\n\nFrusciante.net revealed that this was going to be the third of seven songs released as a single from Stadium Arcadium. Before even being released as a single, it climbed to number fifty-three in the UK iTunes top 100 on May 13.\n\nIn an interview, Tony Kaye, who also directed the video for \"Dani California,\" told MTV he would be directing the video for the song. However, his footage wasn't used. Instead, Warner commissioned director Nick Wickham to shoot a new video showing the band at the 17 October and 18 October 2006 shows at Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey, along with black and white film of fans at the parking lot and lines at the live show.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, \"Snow ((Hey Oh))\" became the band's record breaking 11th number one Modern Rock single in the United States and is the third consecutive chart-topping Modern Rock single from Stadium Arcadium.\n\nThe song is played during the credits of the second Death Note movie, Death Note: The Last Name. It was also used by ESPN in commercials for the X Games. During the summer of 2007, the song was used in a promotion for the new season of PBS's news-magazine program Frontline. It was even used in some TV Spots for the 2006 film Happy Feet. The song was also used as a theme song for WrestleMania XXIV. The song is also available for download on the Rock Band series. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/_/Snow+((Hey+Oh))\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
