In an interview with Hot 97, Kendrick Lamar admitted he thought \"i\" was the best song he's ever written, because he was able to make a positive song out of the negativity he grew up with. The single version is different from the album cut in a variety of ways. The album version was recorded to sound like a live recording and features Kendrick's hype man at the start. Roughly two-thirds through the song, it is interrupted by an argument offstage which causes Kendrick to launch into a new acapella verse.   <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/i\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
