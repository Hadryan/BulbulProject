In an interview with Songfacts, Seltmann said:\n\nI had been listening to Feist's album Let It Die . I thought my little song about lost love, and the hope to recapture what you once had, sounded too much like a Feist song for me to use for New Buffalo, so I shelved it. Then, in late 2005 I did a tour across Canada supporting Feist, and [[Broken Social Scene]]. After meeting Feist, I started to wonder whether she might like to do a cover of \"1234,\" but I was too shy to tell her about it. At the last Broken Social Scene show, I plucked up the courage to tell her that I had written a song which I thought she might like to use. We went onto the tour bus, and I recorded a simple version of the song into her laptop, with guitar and vocals. To my surprise, she loved the song, and started playing it live.\n\"1234\" was nominated for Grammy Awards in the categories of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video. Likewise, the success of the song largely contributed to Feist's other nominations that year for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album. This song was #19 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. \"1234\" also won the Juno award for Single of the Year on 6 April 2008 in Calgary, Alberta|Calgary. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Feist/_/1234\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
