It was released in 1988 as the second single from the band's ninth studio album Peepshow.\n\nThe song is an uptempo number which reflects the pop music direction Siouxsie & the Banshees were recording at the time. Still, the track contains alternative elements and Sioux's trademark cryptic lyrical content. According to Siouxsie, the song was inspired by a technique used by butterfly collectors to keep the beauty of the animal. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees/_/The+Killing+Jar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"The Killing Jar\" is a song written, produced and recorded by English rock band Siouxsie & the Banshees.

Still, the track contains alternative elements and Sioux's trademark cryptic lyrical content. According to Siouxsie, the song was inspired by a technique used by butterfly collectors to keep the beauty of the animal. \"The Killing Jar\" was remixed slightly for its radio version, most notably in the song's introduction and percussion throughout. The single version of \"The Killing Jar\" is featured on the Banshees' 1992 compilation Twice Upon a Time: The Singles.\n\nFollowing the number-one success of their previous single \"Peek-a-Boo\" on American modern rock radio, \"The Killing Jar\" nearly matched the feat, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single hit number forty-one on the UK singles chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees/_/The+Killing+Jar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
