As the album Master of Puppets follows a similar track arrangement as Ride the Lightning, Welcome Home (Sanitarium) is consigned to the ballad track, as was done with Fade to Black, and follows a similar musical style - both songs shift style about 3/4ths through from restrained to incontinent and feature lengthy solos from Kirk Hammett. \n\nThe song is inspired by the novel and film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (written by Ken Kesey) and addresses similar themes. It also shares melodic elements with Rush's song \"Tom Sawyer\" and Bleak House's song \"Rainbow Warrior\"; Metallica thanked Rush in the liner notes to the album for this reason. Most of the first half of the song is in 10/4. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Welcome+Home+(Sanitarium)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
