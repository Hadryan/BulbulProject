The narrator describes a character who is beautiful: \"your eyes are like two jewels in the sky\" but for whom the narrator's love and admiration are not reciprocated (\"but I don't sense affection no gratitude or love, your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above\"). The song deals with themes of abandonment; the apparent end of a relationship and the concept of a coming journey. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/One+More+Cup+of+Coffee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"'One More Cup of Coffee' tells the tale of a girl whose family are romani and drifters, and of the man who must leave her to enter the \"valley below\". The narrator describes a character who is beautiful: \"your eyes are like two jewels in the sky\" but for whom the narrator's love and admiration are not reciprocated (\"but I don't sense affection no gratitude or love, your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above\"). The song deals with themes of abandonment; the apparent end of a relationship and the concept of a coming journey. The song could be seen as a metaphor for Dylan's relationship with Sara; however, this is unsubstantiated. The song is also thought to have been inspired by a visit Dylan made to Saintes Maries de Mer in Provence, France, where there is an annual gathering of Romany people who venerate Saint Sarah the Egyptian. This would seem to point to another link to Sara Dylan. (Ref. Picknett,L. and Prince, C. \"The Templar Revelation\" , 1997, p. 90.)\n\nThe song is a duet between Dylan and Emmylou Harris; as an incidental to its use of the harmonic minor scale it has a decidedly Middle Eastern flavor in the vocal melody. It was covered by The White Stripes on their self-titled debut album. Furthermore there is a version by Roger McGuinn and Calexico for the 2007 film I'm Not There. Calexico also performs the song at their concerts. Robert Plant covered the song in his 2002 album Dreamland. In 2003, Sertab Erener covered this song which in turn became the soundtrack of the movie Masked and Anonymous. In 2009 Italian rock noir band Belladonna covered the song in their Rome, Italy show. Frazey Ford included a cover of the song on her 2010 debut solo album, Obadiah. The song was written at a corner table at the Other End nightclub in Greenwich Village in the summer of 1975.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/One+More+Cup+of+Coffee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
