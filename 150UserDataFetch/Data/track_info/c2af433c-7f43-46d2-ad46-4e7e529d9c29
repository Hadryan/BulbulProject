The choir was added afterwards. The whole section used about 11 different tracks. Also Ian on timpani can be heard in the background. The second section is Jon's orchestral description of April. The instruments used were : two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two violins, viola and two cellos. The third section is a treatment of the chord sequence of the first section in a more \"Purple\" way. As a whole, we hope April hangs together as personal evocation of a beautiful, but sad (to us) month. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple/_/April\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
