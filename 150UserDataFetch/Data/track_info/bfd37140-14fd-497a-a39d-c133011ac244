Some sources claim that June had seen the phrase, \"Love is like a burning ring of fire,\" underlined in one of her uncle A. P. Carter's Elizabethan books of poetry.\n\nThe song was originally recorded by June's sister, Anita Carter, on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1962) as \"(Love's) Ring of Fire\". It was released as a single and was a featured \"pick hit\" in Billboard magazine. When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita, Cash recorded it his own way, adding the mariachi-style horns. Mother Maybelle Carter and The Carter sisters feature prominently singing harmony. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Ring+of+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
