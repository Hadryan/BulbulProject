In regards to Women, however, I doubt I could dream up a better description than the one I just read in a Wikipedia article which states, “The band’s sound has been likened to sunny Beach Boys pop was dragged into a dark alley and gleefully mutilated”. *Take a moment to visualize this* In more concrete terms, Women can be described as, dare i say it, indie/mathrock/pop. Reminiscent of Maps and Atlases in their rhythmic idiosyncrasy, but more akin to the droning harmonies of Deerhunter in their melodic sensibility. Their vocal lines are very dynamic and really pull you in, very Brian Wilson-esq. Hailing from Calgary and featuring two brothers, Women are set to embark on a tour featuring quite a few SXSW dates as well as a number of shows alongside Pitchfork darlings, Wavves and LA based, Abe Vigoda. Their debut self-titled album was released last fall on Flemish Eye and Jagjaguwar (one of my favorite labels).\"\n\naccessed by drrcjones and copied here on 27 March 2009 from\nhttp://thetapeisnotsticky.com/2009/03/women/\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Women/_/Black+Rice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
