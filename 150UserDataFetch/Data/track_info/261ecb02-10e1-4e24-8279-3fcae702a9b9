It won a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. Adam Jones made a video for this song using stop-motion animation that appears on Salival. The song reached number twenty-five on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\nKeenan incorporates into the lyrics part of comedian Bill Hicks' \"Arizona Bay\" routine by telling the listener to \"learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay.\" Hicks appears in the liner notes/sleeve as a mad doctor, and a lenticular image below the CD case tray illustrates California falling into the sea, as is spoken of in the song. California falling into the sea is a prediction made by Edgar Cayce, also known as \"The Sleeping Prophet,\" about the end of days in which California and New York are to sink into the ocean among a plethora of other devastating weather changes.\n\nIt also refers to the Church of Scientology with the line \"Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones\", this is because the band members of Tool are opposed to the brainwashing behaviour and supression of freedom in Scientology. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/%C3%86nema\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
