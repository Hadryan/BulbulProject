It is often wrongly said that the band felt the song to be too soppy for release. In actual fact they always felt the song had potential but were never satisfied with the recording. After a number of failed attempts to record the song, the band were finally pleased with it. The song was written before the release of The Man Who.\n\nDuring live performances of the song, it is typically dedicated to members of the band or stage crew who have reached a significant moment in a relationship. For example, during the 12 Memories tour in 2003, it was dedicated to the lighting manager who had just had a child. In 2007, whilst playing at the Hammersmith Apollo, it was dedicated to their touring pianist Klaus, who had become engaged the day before.\n\nOne version of the single includes the song \"No Cigar\" which features the vocal debut of Neil Primrose.\n\nThe track topped the British Airplay charts and debuted at #18 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe video features the band walking around a small town in South Africa where all the residents are pregnant women. A chained up man appears at the end of the video in apparent distress suggesting that he has been held captive and forced to father children for the women.\n\nThe song is also used at the end of the movie Saved!. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Travis/_/Flowers+in+the+Window\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
