The \"Come Wander With Me\" song was composed by Jeff Alexander and sung by actress Bonnie Beecher. \n\nThe song is built into the story. It builds verse by verse together with the events in the episode. Part of the lyrics are not complete, since some verses are not sung in full. The song has been used in several places since its 1964 broadcast. It was featured on the soundtrack of Vincent Gallo's 2003 film The Brown Bunny. It was also used as background music in Belgian director Koen Mortier's 2006 television commercial \"Angels\" for Dutch insurance company RVS. The ad shows flying men with open umbrellas inspired by Ren√© Magritte's Golconda.\n\nIn the The Twilight Zone episode the \"Rock-A-Billy Kid,\" Floyd Burney, arrives at a small town in search of a new song. He is directed to a dilapidated shop in the woods run by a reclusive old man. After his offer of money in exchange for an original song is rebuffed, Floyd hears a voice singing and wanders off through the woods, not seeing a nearby tombstone inscribed with his name.\n\nNext to a lake, he encounters a pretty but mysterious woman, Mary-Rachael, who reluctantly plays a song for him about two lovers who meet in the woods and are torn apart by tragedy. Floyd offers to buy the song rights from her, but she claims it isn't for sale. As he tries to seduce her, a jealous young man named Billy Rayford shows up and attacks Floyd, who defends himself, killing Rayford.\n\nMary-Rachael's song reflects the event, and foreshadows a future attack. As Floyd runs off, he looks back and sees that Mary-Rachael's clothes have changed; she is now dressed in black, with a black shawl, mourning.\n\nSoon, Billy Rayford's brothers arrive to chase after Floyd. As he prepares to flee, Mary-Rachael begs him to stay, hoping things will be different \"this time\". She implies that these same events have occurred before. Ignoring her, he runs away and finds himself back at the shop in the woods. The old man declines to help him hide, and in his anger, Floyd kills the old man, then hides among the old musical instruments in the shop.\n\nBilly Rayford's three brothers arrive at the shop, see the old man's body, and when Floyd bumps a music box, the brothers close in on him and shoot him. The camera returns to the image of the tombstone in the first scene, thus fulfilling the prophecy within the song that Floyd would die.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Alexander/_/Come+Wander+With+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
