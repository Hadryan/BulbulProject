Marley laments Jamaica's high crime rate and unceasing violence, demanding that those in charge do something about it. In this sense he carries on the legacy of his father before him, in inspiring Jamaicans to stand together.\n\nBoth the rhythm (known as World Jam) and the hook are sampled from the 1984 track \"World-A-Music\" by Ini Kamoze - the original rhythm from the Ini Kamoze album was provided by Sly and Robbie.\n\nThe track also samples the bassline from Zap Pow's hit song \"Reggae Music\". An edited version of \"Welcome to Jamrock\" was featured on the popular video game franchise FIFA 06.\n\nThe song was also on the playlist of the video game Midnight Club 3, but on the remix version.\nThere are many remixes to this song. One features G-Unit rapper Tony Yayo in a diss towards the rap group D-Block. Another features The Notorious B.I.G. Finally, a remix called \"Welcome to My Block\" features 2Pac, Nas, and Scarface. The Game released a diss song towards Tony Yayo and 50 Cent called \"Body Bags\" which samples the chorus, while a remix featuring 2Pac, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre is also available on the mixtape circuit.\n\nThe originally-released recording contains the lyrics Funnyman a get dropped like a bad habit. A 'funny man' has in Jamaican English the same meaning like 'batty bwoy' or 'chi chi man', both pejorative designations for homosexual men. Since the widely-spread homonegativity in Jamaica and its reflections in popular Jamaican music has been a subject of heavy criticisms and protests outside of Jamaica, the word \"Funnyman\" has been edited out on following releases and remixes of the song, and when performing the song live Marley uses the word 'Babylonians' instead. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Damian+Marley/_/Welcome+to+Jamrock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
