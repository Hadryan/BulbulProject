The track was reproduced by Coldplay and British producer Ken Nelson for the band's debut studio album, Parachutes.\n\nFollowing their successful releases in 2000, Coldplay and their record label Parlophone thought there was enough exposure of the album in the United Kingdom. Thus, the decision of releasing a fourth single would be for regions that had not been overdosed by the hit singles \"Yellow\" and \"Trouble\". They settled on \"Don't Panic\", which at the time was an audience favorite. The single was released in some European regions, and the United Kingdom only received a promo edition. The critical reception of the song was generally positive. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Don%27t+Panic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
