This typical piece of instrumental Porcupine Tree was seemingly inspired by Italian director Tinto Brass and starts out with some Japanese spoken text.\n\nRegarding the Japanese spoken part of the song, Steven Wilson said: \"Oh, yes, it's spoken in Japanese! It's my girlfriend who's Japanese and she's got a film book. I tell you it's so difficult to find anything on Tinto Brass in England. He's completely unknown. I mean, I didn't know who he was. I just saw his name by accident on a video cover. So I'm gradually finding out more and more about him. I kept looking for stuff about Tinto Brass on English film-books and film-guides, but I couldn't find anything at all. And then my girlfriend has some Japanese film-books and so I asked her to have a look in them to see if she could find Tinto Brass' name. And she did. She found this little biography: where he was born, the films he made. So she said 'well, should I translate that for you?' (Because I wanted it to be spoken in the track) and I said 'No, it's great' - I thought - 'I'll have it in Japanese'. So she just read it in Japanese. But it's just a list of his films and where he's from... It's nothing interesting\".\n\nThe track has been performed on most Porcupine Tree gigs between 1999 and 2003, but has not been performed since. Three live versions are available: a 1999 board recording on the \"Pure Narcotic\" single and the 2001 limited German version of \"Lightbulb Sun\", a live-in-studio recording from 2002 on \"XM\" and a 2001 version as a free download from the band's official download store (this version is taken from the same concert as the \"Warszawa\" live recording, but was cut to fit a single CD). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Porcupine+Tree/_/Tinto+Brass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
