The most recognizable pattern to the song is the repetition of the line A friend in need's a friend indeed at the beginning of each verse. The song has been featured often in British television advertisements. One of said adverts is for the Lexus IS200.\n\nThe video, directed by Nick Gordon, portrays police attempting to negotiate Brian Molko's character down from a building he is about to jump off. Band members appear briefly and are being arrested. You can assume from this that they along with Molko are supposed to be robbers, but Molko has decided to end his life rather than be arrested. At the climax of the video, Molko crosses his fingers and jumps off the building but lands on the side half-way down and proceeds to walk down the wall.\n\nThis song was also included on the Big Shiny Tunes 3 compilation and is also featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Chumscrubber. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Placebo/_/Pure+Morning\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
