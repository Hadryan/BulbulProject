It was voted as the 16th greatest guitar solo of all time by Guitar World magazine. It is included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nPage's legendary guitar solo on this song inspired a young Eddie Van Halen to invent his \"tapping\" technique after he saw Led Zeppelin perform live at the Long Beach Arena in 1972.
