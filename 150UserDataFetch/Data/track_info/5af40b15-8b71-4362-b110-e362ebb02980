Loreena first enjoyed their work via the CD A Russian Easter (Philips), and their performance on “Dante’s Prayer” is an exerpt from “Alleluia, Behold The Bridegroom”, which you can also find on A Russian Easter.\n\nLoreena says: “There is something about the simplicity of voices singing in unison in a choir that has always had a special magic for me, whether it is at Christmastime in church or other gatherings, or throughout a variety of cultural and religious traditions around the world. Singing in a group is one of my earliest memories of making music, and it reminds me that in many places around the world, music is still something to participate in, rather than merely a fashion commodity to be purchased.\n\n“The special sound of choral voices is something I hope to explore once again in the studio. It adds an air of community and shared experience that is very precious.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Loreena+McKennitt/_/Dante%27s+Prayer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
