I started off with the guitar and did a multitracking experiment in the control room or maybe in the little room next door. It was very home-made; it wasn't a big production at all. I just made up this short piece and I multitracked a harmony to that, and a harmony to that, and a harmony to that, and built it up sculpturally with a lot of vibrato on the [guitar] strings, really pulling the strings madly. Hence, 'Wild Honey Pie', which was a reference to the other song I had written called 'Honey Pie'.\"\n\nAccording to McCartney the song might have been excluded from The Beatles album, but Pattie Boyd \"liked it very much so we decided to leave it on the album.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Wild+Honey+Pie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
