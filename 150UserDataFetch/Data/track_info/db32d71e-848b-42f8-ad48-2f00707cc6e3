There no mistaking the message: \"You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.\"\n\nThe song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 1999. It peaked at #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks and #25 on the UK singles chart.\n\nThe place that closes seems to be a pickup bar, noted by the lines:\n\nOne last call for alcohol \nSo finish your whiskey or beer \n... \nYou don't have to go home \nBut you can't stay here \n... \nSo gather up your jackets \nMove it to the exits \nI hope you have found a friend\n \nHowever, the book So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star (ISBN 0-7679-1470-8) by Semisonic's drummer Jacob Slichter indicates that it is, instead, about being born: the place that is closing is the womb, and the mention of alcohol is a reference to pregnant women not drinking. This can be seen in the lines:\n\nTime for you to go out\nto the places you will be from \n... \nThis room won't be open\n'til your brothers or your sisters come\n \nThis interpretation has additional support. In a show in which he opened up for Sondre Lerche, Dan Wilson noted that the song was NOT written for the birth of his child; in an attempt not to be one of those annoying songs that an artist wrote for the birth of a \"jr,\" he made sure the meaning was abstracted. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Semisonic/_/Closing+Time\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
