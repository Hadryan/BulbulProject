The entire band performed a version of the song with jazz pianist Chick Corea during the Grammy Awards in 2004.\n\nBoth of the band's official live DVD releases, 2003's Everywhere but Home and 2006's Skin and Bones, feature acoustic performances of the song.\n\nGlen Campbell recorded the song for his Meet Glen Campbell album in 2008.\n\nThe song was used by George W. Bush for his 2004 re-election campaign without the band's knowledge. When Grohl found out about it, it prompted him and the rest of the band to get more politically active, and they helped John Kerry's campaign as a result.\n\n'Times Like These' has also been released as a Rock Band and Rock Band 2 DLC track on Xbox Live and PSN on December 23, 2008. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Times+Like+These\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
