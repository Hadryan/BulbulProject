Possibly because of this, the song is listed as \"Silent Running\" on many later releases, such as the Hits album.\n\nThe song has been banned by the BBC since the Gulf War due to its address of war, nationalism and religion, as well as a direct reference to weaponry in the line, \"There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.\"[5]\n\n\"Silent Running\" was one of the first songs to come from the Rutherford/â€‹Robertson songwriting partnership. It was, in fact, one of a series of songs that the two wrote simply to test how effective collaboration between them would be. When producer Christopher Neil heard it on a demo tape that Rutherford played for him, however, he recommended that it be used for the album.[6]\n\nAccording to Rutherford, the song is about a guy who's traveled light-years away, out in space somewhere, and he's ahead in time. Therefore he knows what's going to happen to his wife and kids back home, on Earth. And he's trying to get the message to them to say what's going to happen, the kind of anarchy, the breakdown of society, to tell them to be prepared.[6]\n\nThe song's video features a few clips from the film Choke Canyon, but is primarily based on the completely unrelated story on which the song's lyrics are based.[7] Billy Drago makes a cameo appearance in the video.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+&+The+Mechanics/_/Silent+Running\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
