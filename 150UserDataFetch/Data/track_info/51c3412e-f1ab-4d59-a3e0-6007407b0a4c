At first, he is a man getting ready for a date by buying some roses and a bottle of wine at a deli. He then tells the butcher \"goodbye\" and the camera reveals that the butcher is in fact Cherry himself. A robber wearing a ski mask then comes along and takes the money out of the cash register. As he leaves, however, he is run over by a van, and as bystanders help him up, he is revealed to be Cherry, as is the driver in the van. Another Cherry is seen playing a guitar and another is a bum on the street. The \"first\" Cherry appears once again at the end of the video, apparently walking to his date's place.\n\n1998 Chart  Peak position\n____________________\nAustrian Singles Chart  -  #17 \nBelgian Singles Chart -  # 9 \nDutch Mega Singles Top 100 -  # 9 \nFrench Singles Chart -  # 11 \nGerman Singles Chart -  # 18 \nIrish Singles Chart -  #3 \nNew Zealand RIANZ Singles Charts -  # 35 \nNorwegian Singles Chart -  # 9 \nSwedish Top 100 Singles -  # 2 \nSwiss Singles Chart -  # 7 \nUK Top 75 Singles -  # 6 \nU.S. Billboard Adult Top 40 -  # 3 \nU.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks -  # 8 \nU.S. Billboard Hot 100 -  # 5 \nU.S. Billboard Top 40 Mainstream -  # 1 \nU.S. Billboard Top 40 Tracks -  # 1 \nU.S. Billboard Adult Recurrents -  # 1 \n \n1999 - End of year chart  Position \nU.S. Billboard Hot 100  -  #22 \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eagle-Eye+Cherry/_/Save+Tonight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
