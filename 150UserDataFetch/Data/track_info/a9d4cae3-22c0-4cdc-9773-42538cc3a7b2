Calhoun. It was originally recorded by Big Joe Turner, and most successfully by Bill Haley & His Comets.\n\nTurner's version was recorded in New York on February 15, 1954. The shouting chorus on his version consisted of Jesse Stone, and record-company executives Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegün. The saxophone solo is by Sam \"The Man\" Taylor. Turner's recording was released in April 1954, and reached # 1 on the Billboard R&B chart on June 12, but its success did not cross over to the pop chart.\n\nThe song, in its original incarnation, is highly sexual. Perhaps its most salacious lyric, which was absent from the later Bill Haley rendition, is \"I've been holdin' it in, way down underneath / You make me roll my eyes, baby, make me grit my teeth\". [It may actually be \"Over the hill, way down underneath.] On the recording, Turner slurred the lyric \"holdin' it in\", since this line may have been considered too risqué for publication. The chorus uses \"shake, rattle and roll\" to refer to boisterous intercourse, in the same way that the words \"rock and roll\" was first used by numerous rhythm and blues singers of the 1940s and 50s. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Joe+Turner/_/Shake,+Rattle+And+Roll\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
