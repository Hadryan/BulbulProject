Driven by electronic beats, it was seen as a departure for the rock band, but remains a fan favourite, especially at live concerts. Singer Thom Yorke usually dances during the song, and the crowd joins in singing the second verse (\"Ice age coming, ice age coming\"). The song has been played at nearly every concert since 2001.\n\nThe song features a prominent sample from \"Mild und Leise\" - an experimental computer piece from 1973 by electronic music pioneer Paul Lansky.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Idioteque\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"\"Idioteque\" is the eighth track on Radiohead's album Kid A (2000).
