In an interview with Rolling Stone, Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, he knew that the album was missing something. One night, during a stay in Liverpool, Martin found an old piano that was out of tune. He wanted to work on George Harrison's song \"Isn't It a Pity\", but he could not manage to do so. When the song came to Martin, he asked that the recorder be turned on. He concludes with saying that he came across this chord sequence and noted that the chord was \"lovely\". Martin recorded the vocals and piano takes in a studio in Liverpool.\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, Martin said: \"That's just about girls. It's weird that whatever else is on your mind, whether it's the downfall of global economics or terrible environmental troubles, the thing that always gets you most is when you fancy someone.\"\n\nHowever, the inside cover to A Rush of Blood to the Head stated: \"The Scientist is Dan.\" 'Dan' refers to Dan Keeling, the A&R man who signed the band to Parlophone.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/The+Scientist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
