The video features Noel Clarke walking through various environments, tagging and modifying the surrounding landscape, including the WWII Acoustic Mirrors at Denge, to match The Prodigy's ant logo, used in the album The Fat of the Land. It was filmed at Dungeness in Kent and on the Red Sands Fort in the Thames Estuary. The Prodigy band members are also seen in the clip, albeit only for a few seconds.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/_/Invaders+Must+Die\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
