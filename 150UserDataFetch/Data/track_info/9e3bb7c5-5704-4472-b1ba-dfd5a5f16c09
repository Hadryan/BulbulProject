It was recorded live at the Minneapolis club First Avenue in 1983 (with the strings overdubbed later in the studio) and was his third US single (second in UK) and title track from the 1984 album of the same name, which in turn was the soundtrack album for the 1984 film of the same name. The song is an emotional combination of rock and roll, pop and gospel music. It is widely considered Prince's signature song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Purple+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","content":"Purple Rain is a power ballad by Prince and the The Revolution.

The song is an emotional combination of rock and roll, pop and gospel music. It is widely considered Prince's signature song.\n\nIt opens with a lone guitar quickly followed by live drumming and a prominent organ, evoking images of church gospel music. Three verses are followed by a chorus, with a building emotional delivery. After the final chorus, a guitar-solo takes over the song. The song ends with a piano solo and orchestral strings. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Purple+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
