The song is the most successful single by the band, reaching number five in their home country of the UK, and the music video won the 1990 Best British Video at the 1990 Brit Awards.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metaphor for addiction or for depression, and Smith has offered multiple, different explanations as to its theme or content. Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of The Cure on many of its music videos, reported that \"Lullaby\" was, in fact, an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's druggy past.\n\n\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video for \"Lullaby\" was filmed at a sound stage in London, England. It features Robert in bed, in a dream sequence, and the rest of the band playing tin soldiers who sporadically appear throughout the music video for a few seconds. The music video, during which Smith plays both the cannibalistic \"spiderman\" mentioned in the lyrics (which does not refer to the similarly-named Marvel Comics superhero) and his intended victim, concludes with Smith being swallowed by what appears to be a giant spider.\n\nThe music video, directed by Tim Pope and edited by Peter Goddard won Best Video at the 1990 Brit Awards.\n\n\nReception\n\nUpon its release, \"Lullaby\" became The Cure's highest charting hit in their home country when it reached number five; in fact, it remains their only single to reach the Top 5 in the UK\n\n\n\nReleased-10 April 1989\nFormat-7\", 12\"\nGenre-Alternative rock, dark wave, gothic rock\nLength-4:10\nLabel-Fiction Records\nProducer(s)-Robert Smith, Dave Allen <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Lullaby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
