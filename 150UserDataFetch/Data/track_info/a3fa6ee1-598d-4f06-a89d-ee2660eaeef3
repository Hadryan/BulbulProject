The song was chosen as the second single of the studio album, which was released on 21 January 2002 in Australia by Parlophone. With the huge success of Minogue's signature hit single \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\", she decided to release \"In Your Eyes\" as the second single off the studio album. However, the song did not serve as a single in the United States.\n\n\"In Your Eyes\" is a pop song that features a lot of house and disco styles of music. \"In Your Eyes\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising the composition and production; however, some felt it wasn't a highlight to the album. The song was generally successful in the record charts, peaking inside the top ten in countries including Australia (where it debuted at one), Ireland, Finland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark and the United Kingdom, where it sold 164,808 copies, and was certified Silver. It also became a dance club hit in the UK, peaking at number seven on the Club Chart.\n\nThe music video, which featured many visual effects and neon colours, was directed by Dawn Shadforth. It received favorable reviews from critics, praising the visual effects. \"In Your Eyes\" won the Best Dance Award at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2002. The song has been performed in a majority of Minogue's tours and was recently performed on her Aphrodite World Tour in 2011 only in Japan and America.\n\nMusically, \"In Your Eyes\" is a dance-pop song, which features influences of nu-disco and europop. In the first verse, her vocals span and range from F#m-D-D-C#-Bm. When it reaches the chorus, her vocals range from F#m-Bm-C#. The chords basically repeat with each verse it has. According to Popmatters and NME, the described the song as \"another disco-sounding club track that lyrically propels Minogue further into a more sexual sound on the lyrics \"I want to make it with you.\"\n\n\"In Your Eyes\" was released on 18 February 2002. It was originally scheduled for release in January, but was delayed because of the airplay popularity of \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\". It debuted at number three on the UK singles chart, becoming her twenty-second top ten single. The song remained on the chart for seventeen weeks, 3 of which were in the top twenty. It was also an airplay hit in the UK, where it reached number one. The song also peaked at number seven on the Club Chart.\n\nThe single became a hit elsewhere in Europe, reaching the top five in Croatia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. \"In Your Eyes\" was released Canada (where it peaked at number eleven) and Mexico, but not in the United States, where \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" had just been released.\n\nIn Australia, \"In Your Eyes\" was released as scheduled on 21 January 2002. The song was certified gold prior to its release on pre-sales only. It debuted at number one on the ARIA singles chart and became the fourth single by Minogue to reached the top position since 2000. It peaked at number 18 on Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), and stayed on the charts for 18 weeks.\n\n\"In Your Eyes\" featured a music video that was directed by Dawn Shadforth. The video features Minogue in a studio filled with colourful neon lights. There are two sequences; the first features Minogue and a group of dancers in front of a colourful background, the second is simply Minogue spinning before a background of flashing lights. Throughout the video, the two scenes are intercut and gradually fade.\n\nThe video featured an extension of the futuristic theme first introduced in the music video for \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" the previous year. Minogue and her artistic director William Baker had become interested in the street interpretation of robotic, jerky movements and included this is the video. The costumes also represent this interest and were described by Baker as being a mix of \"hip hop chic with sci-fi lunacy\".\n\nReleased to music video channels prior to the single's commercial release, the video was a hit, charting at number one on MTV's Hit List UK and at number four on MTV Europe's top twenty countdown. The video was first released commercially as a DVD single in Australia in 2002, but was also included on the Ultimate Kylie companion DVD, released in December 2004.\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kylie+Minogue/_/In+Your+Eyes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
