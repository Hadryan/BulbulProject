The song was his biggest hit at the time, and his first to reach top-10 status in the U.S., peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. It was also his first single to perform better on the pop chart than the R&B chart, due to the pop/rock format of the song. Guitar solo was voted number 64 on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\nThe song combines a drum machine beat and slow synth buildup for the verses and a full rock chorus. Backing vocals were done by Lisa Coleman and the classic guitar solo was played by Dez Dickerson. In the song, Prince narrates a one-night stand with a beautiful but promiscuous woman (the \"Little Red Corvette\" of the title); although he enjoys the experience, he urges her to \"slow down\" and \"find a love that's gonna last\" before she destroys herself. In addition to the title, he uses several other automobile metaphors, for example comparing their lovemaking to a ride in a limousine. The term \"Little Red Corvette\" has also been suspected to refer to a woman's vagina or clitoris, due mostly to the lyric, \"I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine.\"\n\n# Rolling Stone ranked the song #108 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n# The guitar solo, played by band member Dez Dickerson, was ranked #64 by the readers of Guitar World as one of the 100 best guitar solos of all time.\n# The song is currently ranked as the 87th greatest song of all time, as well as the third best song of 1982, by Acclaimed Music.\n\nA 12\" dance remix of the song was released to accompany the single, and it continues where the album version fades out. The U.S. single was originally released with the album track \"All the Critics Love U in New York\" as the B-side, while in the UK two separate single releases had it backed with \"Lady Cab Driver\" or \"Horny Toad\". Separate UK 12\" releases had the song paired with \"Automatic\" and \"International Lover\", or \"Horny Toad\" and \"D.M.S.R.\". Later, it was released as a double A-side with \"1999\".\n\nThe single was released with another 1999, track, Let's Pretend We're Married.\n\nOn Prince's 2006 compilation album, Ultimate, the dance remix of \"Little Red Corvette\" was a featured track.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Little+Red+Corvette\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
