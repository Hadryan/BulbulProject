The lyrics were written by the band's vocalist, Ian Curtis, who committed suicide in May 1980, a month after the song was released as a single. The song was then re-promoted in 12\" format in June 1980.\n\n\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" was written in August and September of 1979 and was debuted when the band supported Buzzcocks on their UK tour in September and October 1979, and it is one of the few songs in which Ian Curtis played guitar (albeit somewhat minimally). The title of the song is a play on the title of a Neil Sedaka song \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" made popular by The Captain & Tennille in 1975. [1] The lyrics are perceived to reflect the problems in Ian Curtis' marriage to Deborah Curtis, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide. Deborah Curtis had the phrase \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" inscribed on Ian Curtis' memorial stone.\n\nThe song was first released in April 1980 and, after Curtis' suicide that May, became the band's first chart hit, reaching number 13 in the UK. It also debuted at #1 in New Zealand in June 1981. The band broke up after his death and reformed as New Order. \"Love\" was re-released in 1983 and reached number 19 on the UK charts and re-appeared at #3 in New Zealand during March 1984. In November 1988, it made one more Top 40 appearance in New Zealand, peaking at #39. \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" appears on the Substance compilation album. It was first recorded for a John Peel session in November 1979, then re-recorded in January 1980 and March 1980. It is the latter version that appears on Substance. The January 1980 version originally appeared as the single's B-side.\n\nIn 1995, to publicise the release of Permanent, the track was reissued, complete with a new remix done by Arthur Baker and a new radio edit, also known as the Permanent Mix. On September 24, 2007 (2007-09-24), the single was again reissued, in its original configuration. This time, it was to publicise the Collector's Edition re-issues of the band's three albums. Although the single was now issued on the Warner label, it retained all the classic Factory packaging, down to the FAC 23 catalogue number.\n\nOriginal Artist\nJoy Division\n\nLive Statistics\nThis was played 111 times (by Joy Division / New Order)\n\nLive Debut\n\nThe Electric Ballroom, London, England (UK)  26/10/1979 1:01:31 AM\n\nLast Live\n\nClub Ciudad, Buenos Aires (AR)  18/11/2006 12:00:00 AM (New Order)\n\n\nOfficial Versions\n1995 Radio Version (3:40) \nAlternate Version (3:10)  HyperLink\nArthur Baker Remix (4:21) \nBBC Sessions 1979-11-26 (3:25)  HyperLink\nLive 1979-12-18 (3:17) \nPermanent Mix (3:36)  HyperLink\nSingle Version (3:27)  HyperLink\nTrouser Enthusiasts Remix (7:03) \nVideo (3:27) \n\n\nAvailable On\n\nGet Ready (2001)\nCloser (1980)\nSubstance (1988)\nPermanent (1995)\nBlue Monday (1983)\nLove Will Tear Us Apart (1980)\nLove Will Tear Us Apart 95 (1995)\nThe Complete BBC Recordings (2000)\nLes Bains Douches 18 December 1979 (2001)\nPeel Sessions (1987)\nBefore & After (2002)\nAtmosphere (1988)\nFractured Box (2001)\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\nDonnie Darko (2001)\n24 Hour Party People (2002)\nBoston Kickout (1996)\nSkate 3 (2010)\n\nCompilations\n\nThe Best of Peel Sessions (par Bernard Lenoir) (1990)\nPalatine - The Factory Story Vol. 1 (1991)\nThe John Peel Sessions (1988)\nCollected (1999)\nA Strange Kind of Love (1996)\nGeneration Eighties (1995)\nNew Wave Dance Hits: Just Can't Get Enough, Vol. 2 (1994)\nThe Eighties Mix (1998)\nRelax: The Ultimate 80's Mix (1998)\nLost Property (1996)\nNever Mind the Main Stream: The Best of MTV's 120 Minutes, Vol. 2 (1991)\nShine Too (1995)\nOnce in a Lifetime (1997)\nUntitled, Vol. 2 (1996)\nLiving In The Eighties (2000)\nOne + Only (1996)\nPulse 95 FM Essential Retro (1999)\nSound of the City (1992)\nSounds of the Eighties 1980-1981 (1995)\nWave 180 Minutes: Book Two (1999)\nCollege Rock (1999)\nCrush (1997)\nDas Boot - The Final Voyage (2001)\nGoing Underground (1998)\nGuitar Club Classics (2000)\nIndie Top 20, Vol. 3 (1988)\nNew Wave - The Best Of Club Class-X (1995)\nNew Wave Greats 1976-1983 (1999)\nNocturnal (1998)\nRock & Wave Vol. 1 (1992)\nThe Best Punk Album In The World...Ever! 2 (1996)\nTotally Wired (1995)\nTen From Ten (2004)\nTeenage Kicks (2005)\n\n\nPromo Available On\n\n20 Years of New Order (2001)\nJoy Division New Order Collection (1993)\n\n\nBands that covered this song\n10000 Maniacs\nBis\nBroken Social Scene\nChuzpe\nFall Out Boy\nFlowing Tears\nHanky Park\nHuman Drama\nInvisible Limits\nKismet\nLos 7 Definites\nMoonspell\nPaul Young\nPJ Proby\nSimple Minds\nStanton-Miranda\nSwans\nThe Cure\nThe Diary\nThe King\nThe Tea Party\nU2\nUnbroken\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Division/_/Love+Will+Tear+Us+Apart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
