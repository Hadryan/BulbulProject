It is notable for its sparse combination of guitar and bass notes in the intro, and its unique music video.\n\nThe song is mainly about the dark side of Hollywood. The song opens to the \"Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation.\" Kiedis says in his book Scar Tissue that he got the inspiration for the lyric from when he was in New Zealand and he heard a woman on the street ranting about there being psychic spies in China. The track also makes references to the decline in western society, and other topics such as pornography and plastic surgery and even some pop culture references including Star Wars (\"Alderaan's not far away\"), Star Trek, (\"Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement\"), Celebrity Skin magazine (\"Celebrity Skin is this your chin\", although this could also be a reference to Hole's song, \"Celebrity Skin\"), and Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain (\"Cobain can you hear the spheres\"). The line \"teenage bride with a baby inside\" refers to the fictional character Dani California, who is also mentioned in later songs By the Way and the eponymous Dani California. The song's riff closely resembles the song \"Elevation\" off of \"Marquee Moon\" by Television. Guitarist John Frusciante exclusivlely recorded this song and Otherside with a vintage Gretsch White Falcon hollow body electric guitar, he also played these songs live with the White Falcon until 2007 when he retired it for one of his vintage Fender Stratocasters.\n\nIn Kiedis' book, \"Scar Tissue\", Kiedis reveals that the band had enormous difficulty in putting the song together, and didn't think it would even make it on the album, as the lyrics had been written, but they couldn't figure out how the song should be played, and to what riffs. Kiedis then explains that Frusciante walked into the recording studio one day, and exclaimed that he had \"figured it out\". He then played the song as he visualised it, and it went from being a song that could have been an afterthought, to \n\nLyrics:\nPsychic spies from China \nTry to steal your mind's elation \nLittle girls from Sweden \nDream of silver screen quotations \nAnd if you want these kind of dreams \nIt's Californication \n\nIt's the edge of the world \nAnd all of western civilization \nThe sun may rise in the East \nAt least it settles in the final location \nIt's understood that Hollywood \nsells Californication \n\nPay your surgeon very well \nTo break the spell of aging \nCelebrity skin is this your chin \nOr is that war your waging \n\n[Chorus:]\nFirst born unicorn \nHard core soft porn \nDream of Californication \nDream of Californication \n\nMarry me girl be my fairy to the world \nBe my very own constellation \nA teenage bride with a baby inside \nGetting high on information \nAnd buy me a star on the boulevard \nIt's Californication \n\nSpace may be the final frontier \nBut it's made in a Hollywood basement \nCobain can you hear the spheres \nSinging songs off station to station \nAnd Alderon's not far away \nIt's Californication \n\nBorn and raised by those who praise \nControl of population everybody's been there\nand \nI don't mean on vacation \n\n[Chorus]\n\nDestruction leads to a very rough road \nBut it also breeds creation \nAnd earthquakes are to a girl's guitar \nThey're just another good vibration \nAnd tidal waves couldn't save the world \nFrom Californication \n\nPay your surgeon very well \nTo break the spell of aging \nSicker than the rest \nThere is no test \nBut this is what you're craving  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/_/Californication\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
