It is the eighth track on Amos' 1994 album Under the Pink. The song reached #4 on the UK singles chart, and was Amos' most successful international hit at the time. In Australia, the song peaked at #19, and was #35 in radio station Triple J's 1994 Hottest 100 poll, appearing on the compilation album of that year's Hottest 100. The song was also ranked in Blender magazine's The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born at #433.\n\nThe inspiration for \"Cornflake Girl\" came from Alice Walker's novel Possessing the Secret of Joy, about a young African woman going through the ritual of female genital mutilation. Amos was angered by the idea that a mother could subject her daughter to such a brutal act, and the song arose as an exploration of the idea of betrayal between women. In the song two factions of women are referred to: the \"Raisin Girls\" are \"multicultural\" and open-minded, while the \"Cornflake Girls\" of the title are \"narrowminded and full of prejudice\".\n\nThe reference to cornflakes and raisins comes from their distribution in a box of breakfast cereal, implying that \"raisin girls\" are much harder to find than \"cornflake girls\". Amos has spoken in interviews about being referred to glibly as \"the Cornflake Girl\" due to the song's title being applied to her, when she considers herself a \"Raisin Girl\". The confusion is likely related to her 1987 commercial for Kellogg's Just Right, made before her widespread fame. Just Right includes both raisins and corn flakes, so the song and the cereal are related either through coincidence or intent.\n\nAtlantis released a series of Cornflakes boxes with picture of Amos on them to promote this. They are now collector's items.\n\nThe song was covered by post-hardcore band Jawbox as a hidden track on their self-titled 1996 album, as well as by the band Tapping the Vein on the Tori Amos tribute album Songs of a Goddess. In 2007, after Amos had to pull out of an appearance on the Australian comedy program The Sideshow, musical comedy trio Tripod performed the song in her place.\n\nThe term \"cornflake girl\" also appears in the lyrics of the Billy Bragg song \"Body of Water\" from his 1991 album Don't Try This at Home with the line \"Oh, to become a pearl / In the wordy world of the cornflake girl\".[10]\n\nIronically, Tori Amos' first appearance on TV was for an advert for Kellogs Just Right.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tori+Amos/_/Cornflake+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
