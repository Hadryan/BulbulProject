A remixed version was also released. It is arguably the most successful (at least in commercial terms) of any song of the dream pop genre. The genre is generally viewed as not radio friendly hence commercially accessible. Even now the song is featured on well over 50 compilations and is widely viewed the pinnacle of Julee Cruise's career. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Julee+Cruise/_/Falling\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
