The song peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, stayed on the charts for twenty-three weeks, and became the most played song of 2002 in all of Europe. The song was such a hit that the singer's label cancelled what was planned to be the next single, \"Lover\", and replaced it with \"Get Over You\"/\"Move This Mountain\". It was also a hit in Australia peaking at number three, staying in the top fifty for twenty weeks, accrediting platinum by ARIA and ending to be the eleventh highest selling single for 2002.\nThe music video (which was directed by Sophie Muller) takes place at a dance contest whose winners are to gain a pair of golden shoes and a cash prize. Desperate to win, Ellis-Bextor manages to sneakily injure and disqualify many of the other dancers, poison one judge and seduce another into declaring her the winner, which displeases the other dancers. Her clever use of these tactics leads to her win. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sophie+Ellis-Bextor/_/Murder+On+The+Dancefloor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
