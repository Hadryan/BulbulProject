The White Stripes shot much of the song's music video outside the hotel, but were denied permission to film inside; according to Jack White, the duo is \"sort of banned for life\" from the hotel.\n\nThe song is primarily built around three chords G, C and D, but a fourth, F, is also heard.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Hotel+Yorba\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
