In Japan, an EP was released with the tracks from the U.S. maxi single, and four tracks from the U.S. \"Gett Off\" maxi single.\n\n\"Cream\" was a #1 hit stateside, and it made the Top 20 in the U.K. It was very well received at American radioâ€”peaking at #2 on the Hot 100 Airplay, this was Prince's fifth and currently last #1 hit in the U.S.-- however, it did not make the R&B singles chart, because the track was not sent to Urban radio; \"Insatiable\" was sent to Urban instead. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/Cream\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
