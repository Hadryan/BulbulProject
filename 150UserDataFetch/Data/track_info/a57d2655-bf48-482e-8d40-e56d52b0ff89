It also reached number one in Germany in 1988, and peaked at number four in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 the same year, becoming the duo's fifth and last Top 10 hit there.\n\nIn November 2004, The Daily Telegraph newspaper placed the version at number two in a list of the fifty greatest cover versions of all time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pet+Shop+Boys/_/Always+on+My+Mind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
