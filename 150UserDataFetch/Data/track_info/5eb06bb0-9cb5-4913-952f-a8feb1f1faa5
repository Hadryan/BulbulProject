Recording took place at Cargo Studios in Rochdale, Lancs on 11 October 1978.\n\nIt was the last song ever performed by Joy Division, as it was the final song of the last gig recorded on 2 May 1980 at Birmingham University, just before the suicide of the band's singer Ian Curtis. The entire concert was released on the Still album in 1981, and is also notable for including one of only three known recordings of Ceremony.\n\nThe song features in the films 24 Hour Party People and Control, where Tony Wilson sees the band play for the first time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Division/_/Digital\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
