The song was later covered by Metallica, as the first single from their 1998 Garage Inc. album, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 11 consecutive weeks, the highest number of weeks Metallica has ever spent at the top; drummer Lars Ulrich had heard the original song while driving across the Golden Gate Bridge and later commented that he thought it \"Had James [Hetfield] all over it\". Metallica's rendition is taken at much the same tempo as Seger's, but with a heavier feel; the saxophone part is replaced by a high slide guitar line from Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield played a guitar solo before the last run through the chorus. Metallica's music video for the song, directed by Jonas Ã…kerlund, is about the life of a stripper who prostitutes herself while she is trying to raise a child; the prostitute/stripper is played by Ginger Lynn Allen. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Turn+the+Page\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
