In response his older brother sings this song to comfort, as well as tell him the reality, with an appeal for his deceased parents to protect this child in the land of the living (local ancient belief is that the dead care for loved ones they left behind).\n\nCelsus Eloga Talifilu and his relatives helped to transcribe and translate the lyrics of this lullaby. Celsus is son of Saverio Talifilu who was the Baegu headsman that organized the recording session with Hugo Zemp. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Forest/_/Sweet+Lullaby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
