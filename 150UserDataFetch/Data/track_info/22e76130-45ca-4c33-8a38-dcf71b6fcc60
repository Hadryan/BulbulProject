Initially released in 2011 as single from their album Lunatic, \"Come with Me Now\" found commercial success in the United States in 2014, eventually peaking at number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and becoming their first charting single in the United States.\n\nIn 2011, Kongos released their album Lunatic, which featured \"Come with Me Now\" which was released as a single. With the band performing the song live while opening for American band Linkin Park in South Africa, \"Come with Me Now\" was considered a fan favorite there though it initially struggled to find an audience in the United States. The band admitted that when \"it didn't seem like things were getting along we really lost heart - we were ready to move on to new material\".\n\nIn early January 2014, the song began receiving airplay in the US, generating major label attention for the band who was eventually signed to Epic Records.It was released to US contemporary hit radio on 15 April 2014.\n\nThe song will be released in the UK as the lead single off Lunatic on August 17, 2014\n\n\"Come with Me Now\" has been described by Billboard as an \"accordion-tinged\" rock song. Members of the band themselves say that the song is heavily influenced by Kwaito music, which is described as being a blend of South African jazz, township pop, and Western house music.\n\nIt peaked at #1 in South Africa, #7 in Canada,  #34 in New Zealand, and #38 in the United States. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kongos/_/Come+With+Me+Now\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
