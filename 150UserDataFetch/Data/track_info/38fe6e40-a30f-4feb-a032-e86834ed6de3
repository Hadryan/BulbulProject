The up-tempo dance song is thought by some Prince fans to be sung from the viewpoint of Jesus. Regardless, it was a popular dance song of late 1984 and a top 10 hit (the last from the album) in the U.S.\n\nThe extended version of the song is actually a studio jam on the song with The Revolution and musicians from Sheila E.'s band, Eddie M (on sax) and Miko Weaver (guitar), along with Sheila E. herself; most of this version was often performed live, preceding \"Baby I'm a Star\". The jam features some overdubbing and fades at the end; a longer version, nearly 31 minutes long, was never released officially, but has been bootlegged.\n\nThe B-side, \"Another Lonely Christmas\", is a sad account of a man's mourning over his lover's death on Christmas Day. The UK 12\" single release also included the 1999 track \"Free\".\n\nOn the 12\", and in Purple Rain Tour concerts, Prince changes the lyrics from \"I'm your messiah\" to \"He's your messiah\", pointing to the sky as he sings the line. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince/_/I+Would+Die+4+U\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
