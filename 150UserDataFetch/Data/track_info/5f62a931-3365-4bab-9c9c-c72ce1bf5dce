In the end it sounds like [David] Bowie.\"\nDanny Goffey: \"It came about when we were just in our rehearsal studio and we all started singing it over three chords. It's quite easy to play. The easier the song is to play, the better we play it. It just happened really quickly. It was one of those songs that just comes together in 10 minutes.\"\nThough the title of the song is \"Pumping on Your Stereo,\" the band thought it funny to actually sing the word \"humping\" in place of \"pumping,\" and this is how it is thus heard on the recording. In live performances, the band has sung \"pumping\" instead.\nSupergrass can be heard applauding themselves and whooping at the end of the recording, at the very end of this drummer Danny Goffey says, \"Can we go home now?\"\nThe song features in the movie Road Trip. It was also featured in Formula One's video for the 2009 Italian Grand Prix. In 2011, the song featured on a TV advert for the Toyota Yaris. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Supergrass/_/Pumping+on+Your+Stereo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
