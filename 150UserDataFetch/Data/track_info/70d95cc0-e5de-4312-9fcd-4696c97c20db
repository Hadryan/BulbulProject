It's a song about autumn, the composer's favorite season. Towards the end of the song, Morrison imitates a saxophone.\n\n\"Moondance\" is the most frequently played song by Morrison in concert, as it is the only song known to have been played over 1,000 times.\n\nMorrison on the writing of the song\n\nWith \"Moondance\" I wrote the melody first. I played the melody on a soprano sax and I knew I had a song so I wrote lyrics to go with the melody. That's the way I wrote that one. I don't really have any words to particularly describe the song, sophisticated is probably the word I'm looking for. For me, \"Moondance\" is a sophisticated song. Frank Sinatra wouldn't be out of place singing that.\n\nIn the media\n\n\"Moondance\" is one of the moon-themed songs used in An American Werewolf in London, a comedy-horror film released in 1981.\n\nThis song is featured in the 2007 movie, August Rush as performed by Jonathan Rhys Meyers with Robin Williams playing harmonica and also features an instrumental version by Chris Botti.\n\n\"Moondance\" is one of the songs featured on the compilation album Michael Parkinson: My Life In Music, which is a 2-disc CD of Michael Parkinson's favorite songs.\n\nAcclaim\n\n\"Moondance\" was listed as #226 on the Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 feature, The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nIt is also one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nIt was listed as No. 19 on the All Time 885 Greatest Songs compiled in 2004 by WXPN from listener's votes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison/_/Moondance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
