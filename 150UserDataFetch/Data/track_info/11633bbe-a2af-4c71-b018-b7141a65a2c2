The single version starts with the guitar, while the album version has David Gahan saying \"Can you feel a little love?\" before a minimal electro beat opens the song.\nThe B-side is the instrumental song \"Easy Tiger\". While the Exciter version is a short interlude, the \"Full Version\" has an extended intro and continues the song with a similar melody underlined by a beat.\nThe music video for \"Dream On\" was directed by Stephane Sednaoui. One of the special parts of the video is that it was filmed on Route 66, which is also a Bobby Troup song that the band covered in 1987 for the \"Behind the Wheel\" single.\nOn June 26, 2001, the band played \"Dream On\" on The Late Show with David Letterman. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/Dream+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
