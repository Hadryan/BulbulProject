The former, while not appearing on the album, was subsequently released on the second disc of the 10th anniversary Legacy Edition of Grace, and is also on the official Jeff Buckley site, with a recent video made of existing footage of Buckley while alive. This video is also found on the DVD that comes with the aforementioned Legacy Edition.\n\n\"I love \"So Real\" because it's the actual quartet that you see in that picture right there that you have on the wall, on the album. And that one I produced live Â­all one moment, the vocal is the first take, all one take. It was three o'clock in the morning.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley/_/So+Real\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
