But then as I subsequently did everything the wrong way round I concluded that it was actually my first time on earth and that I should learn to be a more humble.\" \n\nThe song gained popularity in the U.S. following its use by Apple in an advertisement for their MacBook Air laptop. In the song Naïm sings of being a new soul who has come into the world to learn \"a bit 'bout how to give and take.\" However she finds that things are harder than they seem. The song features a prominent \"la la la la\" section as its hook.\n\nIn the issue dated February 16, 2008, \"New Soul\" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at #9, giving Naïm her first single ever to enter any U.S. chart. It reached #7 on the Hot 100 before falling to #42 the following week making it one of the largest falls from the top 10 in Billboard history. It recently rebounded into the top fifty due to being featured on the Apple MacBook Air commercials. It debuted at number 44 on the Canadian Hot 100, and jumped to #7 on the chart the following week, and #13 on United World Chart, also climbing to #7 the following week. In her birth country of France, the single has reached number 2 so far on the French Singles Chart. It debuted on the UK Singles Chart at #42. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yael+Naim/_/New+Soul\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
