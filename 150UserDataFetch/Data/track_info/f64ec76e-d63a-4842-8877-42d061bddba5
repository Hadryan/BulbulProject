The song begins with a brief lilting section (\"She's not a girl who misses much...\"). Drums, bass and distorted guitar are introduced as this portion of the song proceeds. The surreal imagery from this section is allegedly taken from an acid trip that Lennon and Derek Taylor experienced, with Taylor contributing the opening lines. After this, the song transitions into a Lennon song fragment called \"I Need a Fix,\" built around an ominous-sounding guitar riff. This section drifts into the next section, a chorus of \"Mother Superior jumped the gun\".\n\nThe final section is a doo-wop send up, with the back-up of vocals of \"bang, bang, shoot shoot.\" \n\nOne of the most radical musical accomplishments of the song is its frequent shifts in meter. Beginning in 4/4 time, the song shifts to a 3/4 time for the guitar solo in the \"I need a fix...\" section. This gives way to 6/8, 3/4, and 4/4 measures in the \"Mother Superior...\" section before returning to 4/4 for the majority of the doo-wop style ending. During Lennon's spoken-word interlude, the song briefly switches into 6/4. The spoken word section has its roots in the song later on the album \"I'm So Tired\" because, exhibited in the song's home demo, is a spoken word section in 6/4 time that is almost exactly like the one in \"Happiness is a Warm Gun.\"\n\nAccording to Lennon, the title came from the cover of a gun magazine that producer George Martin showed him: \"I think he showed me a cover of a magazine that said 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun.' It was a gun magazine. I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something.\"\n\nMany different interpretations of the song have been offered down the years. It has been said that, in addition to the obvious reference mentioned above, the \"Warm Gun\" could also allude to Lennon's sexual desire for Yoko Ono (meaning an erect penis) and also to his well documented problems with heroin at the time of the recording of The White Album (in this case, the gun being a loaded syringe).\n\n\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" is Paul McCartney's favorite song on the White Album. Although tensions were high among the band during the album's recording sessions, they reportedly collaborated as a close unit to work out the song's challenging rhythmic and meter issues, and consequently considered it one of the few true \"Beatles\" songs on the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Happiness+Is+a+Warm+Gun\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
