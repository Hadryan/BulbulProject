It was named after the star constellation, Orion, due to the song’s spacey sounding bridge. It was written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Cliff Burton. The song is more progressive than the band’s previous work. \n\nThere are three main parts of the song: the heavy beginning, the spacey interlude, and the ending recapitulation that brings back the heaviness. The song features four solos: the first one by James Hetfield, the second one by Kirk Hammett, the third, a bass solo by Cliff Burton, and the last by Hammett.\n\nThis song was played at the memorial for Cliff Burton, most notably because of the bass solo. It was also played live in 2006 when Metallica played the entire Master of Puppets album.      <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Orion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
