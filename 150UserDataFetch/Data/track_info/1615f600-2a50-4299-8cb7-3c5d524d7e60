It was written mainly by John Lennon and credited to Lennon/McCartney.\n\nThe song is about a young man who is unable to contact his possibly unfaithful girlfriend, even though he sees her through her windows.\n\nAccording to Lennon in 1972, the Beatles' music publisher Dick James was quite pleased with \"No Reply\":\n\n“I remember Dick James coming up to me after we did this one and saying, 'You're getting better now — that was a complete story.' Apparently, before that, he thought my songs wandered off. ” \n\nReviewer David Rowley found its lyrics to \"read like a picture story from a girl's comic,\" and to depict the picture \"of walking down a street and seeing a girl silhouetted in a window, not answering the telephone.\"\n\nIn his last major interview, Lennon said that the song was sort of his version of \"Silhouettes\", a 1957 song written by Bob Crewe and first recorded by The Rays.\n\nMusic\nThe song is in the key of C major. The song form is standard AABA (verse-verse-bridge-verse), without a chorus as such, but including the refrain \"No Reply\". The instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, bass, drums and piano.\n\nOriginally Lennon had intended to sing the higher harmony part of the chorus, as this was the original melody. However, his voice had deteriorated due to excessive use and Paul McCartney had to take this part, relegating Lennon to the lower harmony line.\nLyrics \nThis happened once before,\nWhen I came to your door,\nNo reply.\nThey said it wasn't you,\nBut I saw you peep through your window. \nI saw the light, I saw the light. \nI know that you saw me,\n'Cause I looked up to see your face.\n\nI tried to telephone,\nThey said you were not home,\nThat's a lie. \n'Cause I know where you've been,\nAnd I saw you walk in your door. \nI nearly died, I nearly died,\n'Cause you walked hand in hand\nWith another man in my place.\n\nIf I were you I'd realize that I\nLove you more than any other guy. \nAnd I'll forgive the lies that I\nHeard before when you gave me no reply.\n\nI've tried to telephone,\nThey said you were not home,\nThat's a lie. \n'Cause I know where you've been\nAnd I saw you walk in your door. \nI nearly died, I nearly died,\n'Cause you walked hand in hand\nWith another man in my place.\n\nNo reply, no reply. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/No+Reply\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
