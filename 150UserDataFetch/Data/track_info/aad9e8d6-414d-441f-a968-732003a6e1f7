The track features Chad Kroeger from Nickelback. It has received a considerable amount of airplay on VH1. Dania Ramirez of Heroes stars in the music video. The song has peaked at #26 in the United States of America and #4 in Australia.\n\nThe song is frequently mis-attributed as a Nickelback song because of the prominent vocals by Kroeger, who co-wrote the song. A variety of Santana singles often feature guest vocalists.\n\nThe idea for this music video came from his great nephew, Alejandro. The music video features a man (Freddy Rodriguez of Ugly Betty) about to jump off a roof when he sees a girl (Dania Ramirez of Heroes) dancing. He falls for her immediately and starts to follow her. Eventually he follows her to a club where he watches her dance, and at the end they dance together. Meanwhile, Kroeger and Santana play on the roof of the building. The video seems to integrate both the Hispanic and North American cultures, as a symbol of the two cultures coming together in the song itself.\n\n\"Into The Night\" was a crossover hit as it peaked at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. In Canada it was an even bigger hit, as it surged up to #2 on the Canadian Hot 100. It also reached #4 in Australia, #5 in Turkey, #5 in Italy, #5 in South Africa, and #8 in Spain. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Santana/_/Into+the+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
