It features a sample of Andrea True Connection's 1976 disco single \"More, More, More\". Inspired by The Human League's \"Don't You Want Me\" , the song's vocals alternate between Marc and Sharon Costanzo.\n\nThe song became a sleeper hit when radio stations began playing it in March 1999, three months before Len planned to release its album. \"Steal My Sunshine\" had a commercial single release in July 1999 (see 1999 in music). It received positive reviews from music critics, and its chart success has made Len a one-hit wonder. The song earned a nomination for \"Best Single\" at the Juno Awards of 2000.\n\nThe song's music video was directed by Marc Costanzo and Bradley Walsh, under the stage names The Burger Pimp and B-Rad.When Len had signed to Work Records, one of its demands was to be able to direct its own videos. The group used a $100,000 budget to make the video. It flew to Daytona Beach, Florida with two dozen friends while the area was crowded with people on their spring vacations. They spent much of the budget on alcohol, buying enough that they broke their hotel's elevator trying to lift it. They shot the video in an afternoon so that they could recover from hangovers in the morning and drink in the evening. The scenes were shot without a script or storyboard. In the video, Len and its friends are shown relaxing together and riding on skis, scooters, and go-karts.\n\nMotorrad, whose scooters were included in the music video, later held a promotion giving away scooters of the same model. At the 1999 MuchMusic Video Awards, \"Steal My Sunshine\" won awards for \"Best Video\", \"Best Pop Video\", and \"Favourite Canadian Video\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Len/_/Steal+My+Sunshine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
