The Adagio is a re-arrangement of the slow second movement of Barber's \"String Quarter, Op. 11.\"\n\nBarber was only 26 when  the Adagio was performed, in 1938, by Arturo Toscanini's famed NBC Symphony Orchestra. At the end of the first rehearsal, Toscanini remarked, \"Simple & beautiful!\" This was especially amazing because he rarely conducted pieces by American composers. At first, Barber knew none of this and was angry with Toscanini who had returned the score to Barber without comment. Only later, did Barber realize this had occurred because Toscanini had already memorized the score!\n\nIn 1965, Barber rewrote the score for an 8-person choir as part of his religious work \"Agnus Dei.\"\n\nThe work has been part of many famous performances besides Toscanini's:\n\n1. It was played during the funerals of Princess Grace & Alfred Einstein.\n\n2. It was played in Britain's Royal Albert Hall during a 2001 tribute to the 9-11 victims.\n\n3. It was played on national radio as part of the announcement of President Franklin Roosevelt's death.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Samuel+Barber/_/Adagio+For+Strings\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
