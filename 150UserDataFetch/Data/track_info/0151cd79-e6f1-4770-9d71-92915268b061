Frontman Matty Healy spoke with Songs for Whoever on the story behind the song:\n\"Chocolate tells the story of our relationships with the governing authorities of our small town. Smoking weed, smoking anything I suppose, boredom and what ensues when both parties challenge one another. It’s a love letter to boredom, limited opportunities of expressing yourself and embracing and understanding the make up of where you’re from. Musically and structurally it is the blueprint of our output, but I’d need an entire book to discuss that in detail.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+1975/_/Chocolate\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
