The song is notable not only for its controversy, but also for being one of the first Guns N' Roses songs that Axl Rose wrote solo. According to interviews at the time, Rose wrote \"One In A Million\" on guitar (an instrument he was not proficient in at the time), using only the bottom two strings. This differs from other Rose-written Gn'R songs, which Rose composed on piano or keyboards.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses/_/One+in+a+Million\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
