The single was released on April 25, 2000 and peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song also appears on Rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003).\n\nThe song was composed by bassist Jeff Ament. Ament plays upright bass on the song giving it a very atmospheric feel. Guitarist Mike McCready used a Fender Pedal for the song which provided the song with its distorted sounds.[1] The song was recorded using binaural recording techniques, and was produced by Tchad Blake. \n\nAment on the song:\n\"It was just a little ditty on a demo that I kind of played some hand drums on, and had this little song. Actually, I spent quite a bit of time with the lyrics, and I think Stone initially said, 'Let's try that one.' There were little sections of the song [where] I definitely heard Mike doing his thing, so I kinda said, 'Hey, man, you need to write a theme for these little sections.' It's pretty cool to see a little song that I wrote being played by everyone. I mean, I can almost kind of stand back and just watch this great band play a song...and take it to a completely different level. Mike and Ed [Vedder], they have that ability where they can really raise the level of anything that they play.\"[2]\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/_/Nothing+As+It+Seems\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
