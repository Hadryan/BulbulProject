Despite being part of the series, \"The Unforgiven III\" is structured similar to \"The Unforgiven\", containing a heavy verse and a soft chorus, \"The Unforgiven II\" had the opposite making it different from the rest. \"The Unforgiven III\" is also missing the opening horn note, opening instead with an acoustic piano with a horn section in the background. Also, a major difference is the lack of melancholia and the sense of remorse, evident in its prequels, both lyrically and musically. It was not released as a single, as its predecessors were. A live version was performed for the first time on April 14, 2010 in Oslo, Norway. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/The+Unforgiven+III\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
