The song is notable for Riperton's use of the whistle register. While it is believed that \"Lovin' You\" was the first song to reach number one without the help of a percussion instrument, \"Yesterday\" by The Beatles accomplished this feat ten years earlier.\n\nAccording to the liner notes from Riperton's compilation CD Petals, the melody for \"Lovin' You\" was created as a distraction for her daughter (Maya Rudolph) when she was a baby so that Minnie and her husband Richard could hang out. Maya was in the studio with her mother on the day the song was recorded and Riperton can be heard singing her daughter's name at the end of the song.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Minnie+Riperton/_/Lovin%27+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
