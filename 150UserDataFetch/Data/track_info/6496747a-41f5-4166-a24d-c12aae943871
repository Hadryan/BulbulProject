He has said that he feels it affects people in rock, \"in that they believe that they think they have to act like fuckng prats in order to live up to the legend\"\n\nHe has also been quoted as saying:\n\n\"Jim Morrison's a fat talentless bastard - and he's dead.\"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Anyone+Can+Play+Guitar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
