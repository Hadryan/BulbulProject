It is featured as the first track on The Killers' first album, Hot Fuss. It was written by Brandon Flowers and Mark Stoermer.\n\nDespite not being a single, \"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\" is one of The Killers' most popular and critically acclaimed songs. It is particularly praised for Stoermer's powerful and melodic bassline.\n\nThe song, which is written in the key of E-flat minor, is told from the point of view of a boy who has been taken in for questioning about a girl's (Jenny) murder. After explaining the incident from his perspective, the boy (voiced by Flowers), claims that he is innocent by saying that \"there ain't no motive for this crime, Jenny was a friend of mine.\" The song has no resolution of the crime and it is never clarified if the boy was guilty. The song was inspired by Robert Chambers' defense of the Jennifer Levin murder charges, in which Chambers claimed he had no motive for the murder, and that he and the victim were \"friends\".\n\nIt is a part of The Killers' alleged \"Murder Trilogy\", three songs detailing the murder of a girl named Jenny, the other two being \"Midnight Show\", and \"Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf\". In an interview with The Guardian, Flowers revealed that it was Morrissey's song \"Sister I'm a Poet\" that inspired him to write songs about murder. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Jenny+Was+a+Friend+of+Mine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
