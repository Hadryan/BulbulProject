In 1976, they recorded with label mates Side Effect on their version of 'Always There'.\nThe band then went their seperate ways with Marlon McClain releasing a solo project entitled 'Changes'.\n\nBruce Carter passed away in 2006.\n\n\npleasure soulwalking uk page\n\n\n2) Pleasure is a Norwegian funky pop band, led by Fred Ball. One hit single was released, 'Don't Look The Other Way', which featured Justine Frischmann (former lead singer for Elastica) on vocals. The song in particular stood out amongst other releases of 2003 for having a dubious 1980s sound to it, which extended to its video. A new album was released in 2007, called Pleasure 2, featuring vocals by Brett Anderson from Suede.\n\n3) Pleasure is an Ojai, California-based 70's hard rock band, formed in 2012.\nPleasure Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pleasure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
