The central core worked as a live band to great acclaim in the 1990s. This led to an album where many great and famous extra members contributed. (see The Cast below) Fergus attracted collaboration. He lived for a time in The Winstanley Shoe Factory, hosting jam sessions with many of the Dublin bands of the time.\n\nRelationships established then continue: Fergus co-wrote and guests with Maria Doyle Kennedy, Glen Hansard, and Liam O Maonlaoi. Many Interference songs were written with lyricist Malcolm McClancy. Gavin Harte worked with Ferg for years to realise the album. They enlisted “DanDan” FitzGerald to design a studio and to oversee the recording and production. Interference made their own album independently. Some of the production techniques were adopted by the current wave of artistes, who make their own albums, often in home studios. Indeed, even U2 borrowed the name, and a remarkably similar logo. Some of the Interference output is strangely prophetic.\n\nhttp://www.irishmusiccentral.com/interference/biography.html\n\n2) Interference was a short-lived band with Anne Demaranis, David Linton and Michael Brown.\n\nForming out of the musical insurgence that was the Noise Fest at White Columns Gallery in 1981; interference coalesced around three key figures of new york’s downtown scene: David Linton, Anne Demaranis and Micheal Brown. Demaranis had just parted ways with an early incarnation of Sonic Youth and co-curated the NoiseFest with Thurston Moore. Linton had headed to nyc a few years earlier with then school/band mate Lee Renaldo, eventually hooking up with Rhys Chatham for a three year stretch. brown, then a twenty six year old phd candidate at nyu, had recently broke rank with Rhys Chatham and drafted a wholly unconventional percussive approach to the fender bass.\n\nFrom their inception through their eventual fragmentation 30 months later, interference charted their course across the stages available to them: CBGBs, the Mudd Club, the Kitchen, etc., ultimately swelling to a quartet with the addition of fellow Rhys Chatham veteran Joe Dizney. in 1982 they recorded an album at Radio City, engineered by Don Hunerberg (Blondie, Kiss, the Ramones, Sonic Youth, Live Skull) and with guest appearances by Elliot Sharp and Sue Hanel (the Swans). originally slated for release on Josh Baer and Glenn Branca’s legendary Neutral Records, the record has remained unreleased, aside from a scant number of self-released cassettes.\n\nAfter the bands demise, Linton remained entrenched in the New York underground art and music scene, through involvement with the Kitchen, the Wooster Group, and Soundlab, which lead him to the early 21st century downtown electronic scene. it was from here that David recruited the remixers which make up the forward thinking companion lp of the 2010 release: David Last, Doily and Criterion (Broklyn Beats), Binsang aka Toshio Kajiwara (phenomena), QPE (agriculture) and the 8-bit gameboy tag team of Bubblyfish & Glomag.\n\nThis album, a quarter century old and born out of New York’s early eighties downtown music scene, still resonates with undiminished invention, and its merits are far beyond that of a musical artifact. With that the social registry is pleased to present the music of Interference in its entirety for the first time. The deluxe double lp set includes both the original unissued lp, painstakingly remastered from the original master tapes, and couples it with an additional remix lp. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Interference\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
