This experimental ambient work, released by Alien8 sublabel Substractif beginning in late 2001 with Haunt Me Haunt Me, Do It Again, won much acclaim. It also familiarised listeners with the producer himself, and not just because it featured his real name rather than a moniker: Hecker's self-titled work was much more personal than his Jetone recordings, its ideological characteristics reflecting his interests and its experimental slant similarly reflected his ambitions. For his self-titled recordings, Hecker drew inspiration from pop culture and showcased his ideas within dense collages of found sounds and computer-generated noise. The producer also performed live extensively.\n\nAs a graduate student studying digital acoustics and software, Hecker spent years dabbling with electronic music before finally debuting as Jetone in 2000 with Autumnumonia for Pitchcadet. The release interested Force Inc, which released Hecker's next album as Jetone, Ultramarin, a year later. Following this popular release, he aligned himself with Alien8, an experimental label based in Montreal. He recorded Haunt Me Haunt Me, Do It Again for the label's ambient sub-label, Substractif, and watched it inspire critical praise upon its release in late 2001. The album proved so successful that Substractif released a follow-up EP, My Love Is Rotten to the Core, less than a year later in hopes of building upon the lingering critical buzz surrounding Haunt Me. Hecker then recorded Radio Amor for Mille Plateaux, Force Inc's experimental ambient sublabel, which released the album in April 2003. Inspired by a 1996 journey to Central America, where he experienced a memorable boat ride off the coast of Honduras, Radio Amor consolidated the various aspects of Hecker's previous two efforts into his most accessible ambient work to date and accordingly won him yet more acclaim. In 2004 Mirages came out, followed by his contribution to Staaplaat's Mort aux Vaches series, a 41-minute live radio set that was released in 2005. \n\nHarmony in Ultraviolet was released in late 2006. His sixth studio album, An Imaginary Country, was released in 2009, followed by Ravedeath, 1972 two years later and Virgins in 2013, all on Kranky Records.\n\nhttp://www.kranky.net/artists/heckert.html\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Hecker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
