They are a band from Switzerland\nThe Dead Brothers Story the dead brothers, more or less what's left of a symphony orchestra after their car crashed today. some heavy metal wind instruments (Tubas, trombones and bass saxophone) a megaphone and a top hat, a nasty french accordion and some sweet lap steel country. Bringing rock'n'roll back to Europe by exploring the musical roots that led to it's birth or what would the european music that led to rock'n'roll, sound like today? They make Satie rhyme with Birthday Party, and the Saints singing Besame Mucho. They're a macabre rock'n'roll party and an old fashioned wedding at the same time. Need your sense of humour when they stage gruesome deaths singing Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers. The Cramps wrote they liked their rendering of Human Fly. The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Tom Waits got their records.Thomas Wydler of the Bad Seeds says their Tod Von Basel penned in the 16th century sounds pretty nasty. Toured tons with Bob Log III and England with T-Model Ford the tale dragger from Greenville, and they know personally the Reverend Beat-man himself. They are fans of The Kift, famous dutch surrealist jazz family. The Dead Brothers sing blues tunes out of ancient Europe (Totentanz) and famous cajun-core french swingh from Bombay. They've been called THE BEST FUNERAL ORCHESTRA along with tubas and electric guitar and the most bizarre act to have appeared in Europe. Felt at home in Russia, but go as much as possible to the swiss mountains. Some say they are paradoxal. Difficult to get along with. Try good food. They started staging a travelling doctor selling some potion from table to table, storming cafis with the well-named Cirque Electrique. They wrote a musical about ...death played on a boat during the swiss national exhibition in 2002, \"Day of the Dead\" featured Eleni Mandell, DJ Khan, Reverend Beatman and the whole dead family.\n\nThis is the text of their last newsletter; d.d. 06-08-2007\n\nDear Friend of the DEAD BROTHERS !\nAs you eventually heard: THE DEAD BROTHERS will not play any shows this year, not next year and who knows if they will ever play again.\nBut please, dry your tears for a minute and take a look at:\nwww.myspace.com/delaneyfdavidson\nYes,DELANEY is starting his Solo project !*\nWe also heard that PIERRE OMER played with a band called MAMA ROSIN.\nAnd we are sure that Dead Alain and Dead Christophe will show up here or there. We will let ya know asap!\nSo have a great summer and enjoy your time until the DEAD will show up...\n\nThey contiue (different setting) under the name The Dead Brother Sweet String Orchestra (newsletter september 2008) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dead+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
