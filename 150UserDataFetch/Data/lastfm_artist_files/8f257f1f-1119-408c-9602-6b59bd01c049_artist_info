There is Paul Lewis, a popular singer-song writer from the DelMarVa peninsula (Delaware + Eastern Shore Maryland/Virginia).  And there is Paul Lewis, the British classical pianist.\n\n1.) Paul Lewis is a popular singer-songwriter from the DelMarVa peninsula (Delaware + Eastern Shore Maryland/Virginia) who performs frequently across Delmarva and the Philadelphia/Baltimore/Washington DC corridor.  The following text is excerpted from his biography page at www.paul-lewis.com:\n\nPaul Lewis’ long awaited sophomore solo debut, Trading Horror Stories, is the culmination of three years of the artist observing life, his own personal misfortune and disappointment married with a blindness to failure and the fortitude of a man who knows that his time is just around the corner. Lewis notes, \"On this CD I had time to stand back and observe the madness and beauty that goes on daily in the world.\" Layered with equal measures of inspiration and frustration, Trading Horror Stories takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, reflecting Paul's state of being while writing it. Lewis continues, \"I've hung out in mansions and lived in my car simultaneously. Either way it was never boring.\" \n\nPaul Lewis enjoyed the kind of musical start most artists would have sold their souls for. \nIn the 90's, the Eastern shore of Maryland saw the beginnings of the artist about to fuse with the proverbial lightning strike. With fellow classmates, and the timing of alternative music's peak on mainstream radio, Paul and the band YNOT hit the beach and started a five-year reign in the clubs of Washington/Baltimore/Philadelphia markets. Paul and his band did what no other bands had done before and none have done since. Sellouts after sellouts. The wave was riding high and money and acclaim were coming in by the carload. \n\nEven with a charting album, Billboard recognition, regional acclaim, and financial comforts, eventually, the band dismantled and Paul moved to Los Angeles. After a self-imposed hiatus, he began a solo career. When Lewis re-emerged from the Los Angeles underground in 2001 with his solo debut CD no one, including Paul knew where it would take him. After receiving critical acclaim and sold out shows at such high profile venues as Genghis Cohen and The Roxy, Lewis decided to return to his roots on the East Coast to record a new CD. \"I love Los Angeles but for the next project I wanted to be back East to record. Sometimes it's hard to be introspective when it's 75 degrees and sunny everyday.” Lewis explains. In an irony as big as the distance between LA and Philadelphia, the same chemistry from the 90's was just around the corner. \n\nHowever, the next few years were challenging for the songwriter, who struggled through a series of personal crises, including the tragic loss of an ex-band mate, another close friend to cancer and a car accident that left Paul in the hospital, unable to perform for the first time in his life. After a few desperate months, he found himself clawing his way back out again, into the studio reconnected with his former band mates. The result is a sublime collection of 13 songs that experiments with jazz, blues and Latin rhythms while preserving his rock–n-roll edge and pop sensibility. As a songwriter, Lewis looks at life…then questions, embraces and screams back at it with a rich vocal that has evolved with newfound levels of soul and strength. \n\nProfessionally, Lewis has performed over 4,000 live shows and the experience has served him well. His live performance has all the ingredients of a true rock show volume, passion, sex, drama, and charisma. A creative and captivating performer that pulls the audience in and doesn't let go. Lewis jokes, “Music first, then sanity.” Paul has immersed himself in touring for the new recording. The early response has been reminiscent of a familiar time in the 90's. \n\n2.) Paul Lewis, born in 1943 in Brighton, England, has composed prolifically for British television since the age of 20, as well as producing a large body of tonal and melodic concert works. His TV scores for drama series such as 'Arthur of the Britons' and 'The Prisoner of Zenda', children's series such as 'Seal Morning' and 'Woof!' and comedies such as 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and 'The Benny Hill Show' have been heard all around the world, and his instrumental works, several of which are in U.K. exam syllabuses, are usually happy and romantic, inspired mostly by favourite places, close musician friends and loved ones. The Campion Cameo label has issued a CD of his TV themes and his orchestral concert music appears on CD alongside the music of other English composers such as Arnold, Holst and Delius.\n\n3.) Paul Lewis is a British classical pianist who gained international fame in 1994 when he won Second Prize in the World Piano Competition in London. Since then, he has been in demand both as a soloist (particularly noted for recordings of Beethoven and Schubert) and with many of the world's leading orchestras. Born in Liverpool, England in the early 1970s, Lewis attended Chetham's School of Music in Manchester and London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama, before studying privately for several years with Alfred Brendel.\n\n4) The group ‘Bassix ’ was from Miami Florida.
