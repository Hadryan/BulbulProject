He started it together with his brother, Gioacchino, and a childhood friend, Francis Maggiulli. Between 1989 and 1997, \"Charts\" released 5 albums : \"L'océan sans fond\" (1989), \"Notre monde à nous\" (1991), \"Hannibal\" (1994), \"Acte 1\" (1995), and \"Changer\" (1997).\n\nAs the band began to lose its momentum, Calogero decided to launch himself as a solo artist and gathered important connections by writing songs and collaborating with already popular artists, such as Zazie and Pascal Obispo. The latter helped produce Calogero's first solo album Au milieu des autres (2000). His second album, Calogero (2002) was a huge success with the hit singles \"En apesanteur\", \"Aussi libre que moi\", \"Tien an men\" and \"Prendre racine\". Finally, in 2004, Calogero released .calog3ro, containing \"Face à la mer\", a duet with French rapper Passi, and several other top singles such as \"Yalla\" and \"Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer\".\n\nCalogero's moving lyrics and frail, tender voice have made him one of France's top pop/rock singers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Calogero\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
