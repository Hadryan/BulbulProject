The name of the band comes from one of the most famous Finnish murder cases of all time. (The murdering of three teenagers one night at Lake Bodom back in the 60's.)\n\nEarly Children of Bodom albums are inspired by classical music and death metal (Red Light in My Eyes pt. 1 starts with a line from J.S. Bach's Invention No.13 in A minor and Red Light in My Eyes pt. 2 includes selections from Mozart's 25th Symphony), and later albums are more inspired by a commercial thrash and hair metal, losing some of its earlier melodic style. A precise definition for their musical genre is discussed by fans and the specialized press alike, often discounting the influences of the band and the composition of songs. The lyrics of their songs are written in the English language and are often of a simplistic nature, dealing with the subjects of death and personal struggles. As the band grows in experience, so does their playing style. They seem to change one way or another with every album that gets released. Even the album cover arts seems to change as the band grows. They are now also hitting the mainstream part of metal, their name and style being more known now. COB continues to inspire many musicians alike and more join the COBHC everyday.\n\nThe bandmembers include Alexi Laiho (lead guitar and vocals), Janne Warman (keyboard), Roope Latvala (rhythm guitar), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Henkka T. Blacksmith (bass guitar).\n\nEx-members are Alexander Kuoppala (rhythm guitar 1995-2003, Jani Pirisjoki - Keyboards (1995-1997), Samuli Miettinen - Bass (1993-1995) and Erna Siikavirta - Keyboards (1998 European Tour) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Children+of+Bodom\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
