Silence stopped being an idea in the minds of Diego Astrada and Gabriel Olivares towards the end of 2004. In the first months of 2005 Guido Bisocoli on Drums, Fernando Larriestra on Bass, Hernán De Angelis on keyboards and Raúl Mendoza on vocals became members of the band as the definitive lineup. In June the same year the band gave their first show, beginning this way a series of shows, which would not stop until the recording of their first independent production, \"Silence\", during September and October. Once concluded, the group devoted the rest of 2005 to its distribution and live presentation. In 2007, Silence recorded \"The Growling Flames\", pre-production work of what would be their first long-play.In 2008 the band suffered line-up changes that would end with today definitive line-up. During 2009, Silence participates on Morbid Angel's show on Argentina in the South American Tour 2009, having the honor to performe just before the Florida Quartet. The band is nowadays producing new material for their upcoming album. Silence was born from the increasing need of it creators to explore new musical paths. Thus, defining their style becomes difficult, since on the one hand, the influences of every member are many and different, and on the other, the project is characterized by not imposing any type of limits to each member..s creative trends. Nevertheless, everything seems to turn around a concept: extreme music, understanding this as a constant trend for penetrating into the limits of the predictable.\n\nRead more: http://www.myspace.com/silenceprog\n\n15. https://silencepgh.bandcamp.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Silence\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
