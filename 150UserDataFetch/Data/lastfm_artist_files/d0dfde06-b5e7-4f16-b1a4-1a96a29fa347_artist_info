artists called Symmetry:\n\n1) Symmetry, a new project from the Italians Do It Better producer Johnny Jewel (of Chromatics and Glass Candy fame) and his longtime collaborator Nat Walker.\n2) Symmetry, a rapper from Providence, Rhode Island.\n3) Symmetry were a 4-piece progressive metal band, based in Bristol & Reading, UK.\n4) Symmetry are a 4-piece progressive pop/rock band based in Los Angeles, USA\n\n1) Over the span of thirty-seven tracks, Symmetry’s “Themes for an Imaginary Film” embraces the elegance of European noir, cut with a lean & violent American razor. Directly in your face & breathing down your neck one minute, & escaping beyond the night sky the next. The attention given to color & detail on these recordings is more graphic than musical. More visual than aural. With no flashy virtuosity to clutter the mood, the album’s pulse thrives on the empty pockets of space left in the wake of throbbing bass & the faint flicker of electro candlelight. Minimal, strict, & always in motion, there’s an oppressive overtone throughout the record that winds itself tight as a clock.\n\n2) The 22-year-old rapper, born and raised in North Providence, threw away an acceptance letter to a university in Florida, opting out of his initial plans to obtain a degree focusing on his animation skills. It was a bold move, and one that he made in hopes of furthering his other passion — music. To date, the move has paid off. Releasing his first cd, Cat Drop Complex, in May 2005, Symmetry sold nearly 1,000 copies out of his back pack. The 19-track effort helped him gain attention in areas such as Germany, Seattle and Maryland — all of which have hosted him for several shows — and afforded him the opportunity to tour in Canada with indy rap favorites Busdriver and Motion Man. On March 2, 2006, he released Dusty Pickup, his second full-length CD . The 18-track album is the latest release from Poorly Drawn People, the Rhode Island-based hip hop label. Produced entirely by label mate dox, Dusty Pickup represents a more personal, mature effort from Symmetry. Shunning the cliches that have become staples of hip hop music, Symmetry tackles concepts including failed love, a friend’s drug addiction and his own mortality.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/symmetryhiphop - Website\n\n\n3) Symmetry were a 4-piece progressive metal band, based in Bristol & Reading, UK.\nClevery arranged vocal melodies have drawn comarisons to such contempary acts as Tool and Earthtone9, whilst the underlying music is reminiscent of the epic riffs laid down by Pelican and Cult of Luna.\n\nSigning to UK Label, Iapetus Recordings (The Ocean, Paul Marshall, Montana) in early 2006, their debut MCD ‘This is not the end. It is the beginning. You cannot falter now.’ was released to an excellent response from the press.\n\n“Impressive, epic clout… an ambitious debut EP.” KKK - Kerrang\n“A new breed of UK talent on show here.” 7 / 10 - Rock Sound\n“A sterling debut effort.” 4 / 5 - Big Cheese\n“This is special. Let Symmetry apprehend your ears for 20 minutes. You wont need persuading again.” 9 / 10 - Sound Devastation\n\nHaving gained a notorious respect for their energetic and crushing live performances, Symmetry embarked on their debut UK tour in July 2005 alongside fellow UK stunners, Bossk. The tour was sponsored by Rock Sound magazine.\n\nThe band recorded an exclusive track for Rock Sound magazine, titled ‘Let’s Just Wait And See What Happens, It May Not Be As Bad As You Think’. Showing an obvious progression from the MCD, the band have developed a darker sound and now use a mixture of aggressive and clean vocals to widen their musical spectrum.\n\nIn September 2006, the band announced that they would be going on a short-term break whilst members relocated from Bristol back to their native Reading. With demos already recorded for their debut full-length, the band will return in 2007.\n\nhttp://www.symmetryband.co.uk - Band Website\nhttp://www.myspace.com/symmetryband - Band MySpace\nhttp://www.iapetusrecordings.co.uk - Label Website\nhttp://www.myspace.com/iapetusrecordings - Label MySpace \n\n4) Relentless. It’s the word that best describes Symmetry, a progressive pop/rock band based out of Los Angeles. Striving to touch one’s heart and soul through their music, this innovative band consists of Michael Campbell (vocals), Jared Hara (guitar), Will Weiner (bass) and Max D'Anda (drums). These four accomplished and determined musicians fatefully met each other in California and aim to inspire hope through their powerful music.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Symmetry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
