metal triumvirate BLOTTED SCIENCE was formed in 2005 when renown San Antonio, TX guitarist Ron Jarzombek (WATCHTOWER, SPASTIC INK, MARTY FRIEDMAN) approached bassist Alex Webster (CANNIBAL CORPSE, HATE ETERNAL) and drummer Chris Adler (LAMB OF GOD) with the idea of collaborating on a new project that would fuse Jarzombek's signature left-of-center progressive metal approach with Webster and Adler's heavier, more aggressive modus operandi.  However, Adler had to back out due to his commitments with Lamb of God but would collaborate with Jarzombek on the song 'The Near Dominance of 4 Against 5'  which appeared on Magna Carta's 'Drum Nation Vol. 3' compilation in 2006.  Adler's replacement was Derek Roddy  (ex-HATE ETERNAL, NILE) but the new liaison would come to an end only months later due to 'musical differences.'   The album was finally completed with Charlie Zeleny (ex-BEHOLD...THE ARCTOPUS, JORDAN RUDESS) coming into the fold and recording all drums tracks in a matter of weeks.  Produced and mixed by Ron Jarzombek and mastered by Danish studio whiz Jacob Hansen (VOLBEAT, DESTRUCTION, RAUNCHY) at Hansen Studios, 'The Machinations Of Dementia' was released to great critical acclaim on September 18, 2007 through Jarzombek's EclecticElectric label. \nIn September 2010 the band announced that they were working on an EP, with Hannes Grossmann (OBSCURA, ex-NECROPHAGIST) replacing Charlie Zeleny on drums.  An October 4, 2011 release date has since been set for the 'The Animation Of Entomology' EP.\n\n\n\nMeet the Scientists:\n\nRon Jarzombek - guitars: The initiator of BLOTTED SCIENCE, Ron has long been hailed as one of the most unique guitarists and brilliantly creative forces of the progressive vanguard. First coming to the world's attention via WATCHTOWER's seminal 1989 tech thrash masterpiece, 'Control & Resistance', Ron further stunned prog connoisseurs with his abstract 90's outfit SPASTIC INK, put his signature stamp on the acclaimed GORDIAN KNOT debut album, and has toured the US, Europe, and Japan with fellow guitarist MARTY FRIEDMAN of Megadeth fame.\n\nAlex Webster - bass: Recognized as one of the premier bassists in extreme metal through his frenzied work with long running death metal icons CANNIBAL CORPSE, Alex was immediately up for the challenge of what would shape into BLOTTED SCIENCE when first contacted by Ron in 2005. Not only did Mr. Hammer Smashed Bass turn out to be the perfect deathtoned counterpart to Ron's patented madness, resulting in a heavily collaborative effort during the writing stages, Alex also delivers a jawdropping performance and gets to stretch musically beyond what die-hard fans have come to expect.\n\nHannes Grossmann - drums: Joining the BLOTTED SCIENCE line-up in 2010, Hannes takes over for Charlie Zeleny and comes with a technical death metal pedigree that's second to none.  Formerly with NECROPHAGIST, this master of the skins has been stirring up a cosmogenetic maelstrom of epic proportions with Germany's much heralded OBSCURA  for the past four years and is also a member of TERRESTRIAL EXILED featuring Ron Jarzombek. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blotted+Science\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
