He began formal piano training at age 12 before spending his teenage years in a rock band composing his own songs and learning the guitar.  At this time, he also became fascinated by the drums, bass guitar, flute, percussion, and ethnic instruments, such as the Australian didgeridoo, a wind instrument.  His ambition to play as many musical instruments as possible is an edict that has served him well throughout his career.\n\nIn 1996, at age 21, Milli came to the U.S. to attend the famed Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he received his degree in film scoring.  At Berklee, he studied under some of the world’s most renowned musicians and theorists, and immersed himself in Stravinski and early 20th Century contemporary music, but also discovered a great affection for modern, digitally-enhanced compositions.  While he reveres the familiar conventions of film scoring, he is also adept at using digital effects to manipulate sound.  His vision is one of infinite possibilities, a refreshing approach that sets him apart from his Berklee classmates and drives his music till this day.\n\nAngelo Milli, who composed the score for the new Will Smith feature Seven Pounds, is among the industry’s hottest young composers.  His work on the highly-anticipated Sony drama directed by Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happyness), marks the major studio debut for the thirty-three year old composer, whose singular talent and some unmistakable good luck brought him to the attention of director Muccino.   \n\nMilli  has also collaborated with some of the hottest Latin directors  working on scores for five motion pictures including Ricardo de Montreuil’s La Mujer de Mi Hermano, Simon Brand’s Unknown, and Jonathan Jakubowicz’s Secuestro Express (an indie film distributed by Miramax that remains one of Venezuela’s top grossers). That film also brought Milli international visibility, including screenings at major film festivals and a nomination for Best Foreign Film at the 2006 British Independent Film Awards.  He also scored Satanas, the critically acclaimed Colombian film which swept awards at numerous international film festivals and won Milli his first Colombian National Film Award for Best Original Score (that country’s equivalent to the Academy Award).  His other film credits include the thriller Second Coming, shot mainly in Florida and the romantic drama Paraiso Travel.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Angelo+Milli\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
