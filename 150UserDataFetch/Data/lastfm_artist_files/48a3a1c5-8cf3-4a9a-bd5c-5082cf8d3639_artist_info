Known in his country with many hits, like \"Inventor dos Amores\", \"Cor de Ouro\" and gained international fame and success through the song \"Balada\". He is often compared to the sertanejo singers Luan Santana and Michel Teló.\n\nHe was born to Alcino and Sebastiana Lima in Minas Gerais but grew up in Goiânia, Goiás. In 1998 while he was just 9, he joined as soloist in a choir and gained attention through his interpretation of \"É o Amor\", composed by Zezé di Camargo & Luciano. Gusttavo cited as some of his main inspirations Gino & Geno, Chitãozinho & Xororó, Bruno & Marrone and Zeze di Camargo.\n\nIn 2009, Gusttavo released his first independent studio album called Revelação. In 2010, he signed with Som Livre label and released Inventor dos Amores, as a CD and DVD, with sales of 15,000 copies.

The highly popular album reached #7 and was certified platinum. The album produced his definitive hit \"Balada\" (full title \"Balada (Tchê Tcherere Tchê Tchê) based on the famous refrain), which reached #3 in Brazil.
