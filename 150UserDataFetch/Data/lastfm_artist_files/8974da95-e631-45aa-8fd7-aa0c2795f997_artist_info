Eater, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. His arrangement of the original Metal Gear Solid Main Theme was just the first of many striking works he created for the Metal Gear Solid productions that involved both orchestral and electronic textures. His soundtrack for Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty was generally considered a resounding success and an important step forward in blending the mediums of film and video game.\n\nIn his score to the Ridley Scott film Kingdom of Heaven, he introduced a mix of operatic and Middle Eastern themes. One track, \"Ibelin,\" was reprised as the closing credits theme with singer Natacha Atlas performing Arabic lyrics.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released on December 9th, 2005.

Gregson-Williams was a member of Hans Zimmer's Remote Control Productions (formerly known as Media Ventures).\n\nHe is the brother of Rupert Gregson-Williams, who is also a film composer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Gregson-Williams\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
