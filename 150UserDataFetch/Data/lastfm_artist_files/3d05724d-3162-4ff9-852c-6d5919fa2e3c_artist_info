The album was recorded within only 3 weeks. All the lyrics have been written by Cenk Durmazel and music has been made by the whole band. From this point and many other similar things that they have, the band is really alike to Audioslave. Because as Cenk Durmazel was the vocal of another band before and now in Malt the other members of the band were in another rock band called \"üçnoktabir\" and still keep playing on both two bands. \n\nThe album has 10 very powerful rock songs, clearly better than the expected, by far. The very first hit of the album is called \"Aşkın Gözü\".  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Malt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
