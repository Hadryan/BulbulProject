Magalhães and Leão formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro joined in 1986. They'd been searching for a female singer, and found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa liked their music and agreed to join, so in 1987 Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias da Madredeus.\n\nThe first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a disused abbey in Lisbon (Convento da Madredeus. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon's tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the line's nearby terminus, Madre de Deus (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular Madredeus.\n\nIn 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalhães left the band temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by José Peixoto (Classical guitar). Magalhães rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists.\n\nThey released several albums and became very popular in Portugal, but remained relatively unknown outside the country. This changed in 1994 when Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie Lisbon Story - the soundtrack gave the band international fame. Thanks to that, Madredeus spread their wings to the world and conquered fans from all over Europe, South America, Africa and Asia.\n\nIn 1994 Rodrigo Leão left the band to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer).\n\nIn 1997 Francisco Ribeiro and Gabriel Gomes left the band as Madredeus' style started abandoning its fado roots with the release of O Paraíso. At this time Fernando Júdice (Acoustic bass guitar) was invited to join them, to form the current lineup, again a quintet. Madredeus has sold over 3 million albums worldwide.\n\nIn 2007 Teresa Salgueiro announced she would be leaving the band in order to pursue her personal solo projects.\n\nIn 2008, with a new formation and under the name of Madredeus & a Banda Cósmica, they released Metafonia.\n\nIn April 2012 Madredeus announced its new album Essencia. This album is a travel through Madredeus music for 25 years since it was formed. Madredeus announced too its new formation, composed of Beatriz Nunes (singer), Pedro Ayres de Magalhães (guitar), Carlos Maria Trinidade (synthesizer), Jorge Varrecoso (violin), Antonio Figueirido (violin) and Luis Clode (cello). With this new formation Pedro Ayres said in an interview: \"The melody is much more supported, without losing harmonic and rhythmic sense and keeps walking Madredeus\".\n\nDiscography\n\n    * Os Dias da MadreDeus (1987)\n    * Existir (1990)\n    * Lisboa (1992, live in Lisbon)\n    * O Espírito da Paz (1994)\n    * Ainda (1995, soundtrack from Lisbon Story)\n    * O Paraíso (1997)\n    * O Porto (1998, live at Porto)\n    * Antologia (2000, a compilation of 'best of' material)\n    * Movimento (2001)\n    * Palavras Cantadas (2001)\n    * Euforia (2002)\n    * Electrónico (2002)\n    * Um Amor Infinito (2004)\n    * Faluas do Tejo (2005)\n    * Obrigado (2006)\n    * Metafonia (2008)\n    * Essencia (2012)\n\nhttp://www.madredeus.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Madredeus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
