The Second album Kings of Time on the same label in 2004 gave them more publicity. It went to Top40 album list in Finland and was praised by critics[citation needed]. Magyar Posse released their third album, titled Random Avenger May 17, 2006.\n\nMagyar Posse's music is instrumental and usually has a soundtrack-like atmosphere. Their biggest influence is a soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, although their music reminds more of certain post-rock bands like gy!be, Sigur Ros and Tortoise.\n\nThe band has toured in Europe, Russia and China at least.\n\nIn mid-2012 the band announced that they would break up due to a general lack of motivation and passion with the group.\n\n'Magyar' means 'Hungarian' in Hungarian. The band has got its name from Magyar Feh√©r Bor white wine, which is the most popular white wine in Finland.\n\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/magyarposse\nhttp://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Magyar-Posse/21392133822 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Magyar+Posse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
