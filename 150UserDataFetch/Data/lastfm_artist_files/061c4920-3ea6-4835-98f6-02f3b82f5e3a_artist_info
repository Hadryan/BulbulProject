He is considered one of the most important jazz pianists, renowned  for his elaborate solo improvisations. As well as recording under his own name, he has recorded a number of albums as the Keith Jarrett Trio. In 2003, Jarrett received the Polar Music Prize, the first (and to this day only) recipient not to share the prize with a co-recipient, and in 2004 he received the Léonie Sonning Music Prize.\n\nJarrett[ began piano lessons at the age of two and played for the first time on stage at the age of seven. In 1962 he played a self-composed two-hour concert, without the benefit of any prior formal instruction in orchestration or composition. After working with a wide variety of musicians, beginning in 1966, including Chet Baker, Lee Konitz and Art Blakey, he founded his own band in 1968 with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian. In 1971-1976 Dewey Redman (saxophone) joined the group and they played under the name the American Quartet. His work with Miles Davis between 1969 and 1971 gave his career an additional boost and the opportunity to play solo concerts such as the \"Köln Concert\" (1975, Cologne, Germany), honoured by Time Magazine as Album of the year.\n\nSince the early 1970s, he has enjoyed a great deal of success, both artistic and commercial, in both classical and jazz music as a group leader and a solo performer. His improvisation technique combines jazz, classical, gospel, blues, and various ethnic-folk musics.  He is considered by some, to be the \"Bach\" of jazz music. This title may have come from his recording of Bach`s Goldberg Variations, which, although it received many awards, was not entirely approved by critics. \n\nIn the 1990`s he suffered CFS (Chronic fatigue syndrome) only to take up the piano again in 1998. He now works in a trio form with Gary Peacock and Jack DeJohnette. \n\nIn 2003 he received the \"Polar Music Prize\"--the alternative Nobel prize for music and in 2004 he received the Léonie Sonning Music Prize.\n\nJarrett stated in a 2005 TV interview that his music is influenced by the teachings and philosophy of Georges I. Gurdjieff, whom he honoured in \"Sacred Hymns\" (ECM, 1980). This philosophy informs many of his non-musical beliefs as well.  \n\nIn 2008, he was inducted into the Down Beat Hall of Fame in the magazine's 73rd Annual Readers' Poll.\n\nIn 2010, to coincide with his 65th. birthday he released his first studio album in 12 years - Jasmine.  It reunited Jarrett with his old bassist colleague Charlie Haden. The two had not recorded together for over 30 years and hopefully the success of this venture and their obvious enjoyment at playing together will mean more recording of this quality and in this vein in the future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Jarrett\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
