Drawing heavy influence from traditional Americana as well as 80's synth pop and commercial hip hop, the music of CFTPA is a curious mix of austere character studies and playful electronic programming.\n\nOwen Ashworth started to make music on a small casio keyboard back in 1997. His first two albums, \"Answering Machine Music\" and \"Pocket Symphonies for Lonely Subway Cars,\" were made using nothing but small, battery-operated keyboards and Ashworth's own voice (along with occasional accompaniment by guest musicians). These early albums are now available on one CD, appropriately titled \"The First Two Albums by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone.\" \n\nAshworth has released numerous EPs and full-length albums, with a trademark austere lyrical style that conveys emotions through its simplicity and directness.\n\nCFTPA expanded its sound in 2006 with Ashworth's release 'Etiquette,' now using more instruments and effects (as well as more professional production and vocals from Jenny Herbinson). This album has given Ashworth room for experimentation and thinking space.\n\nIn 2009, CFTPA's newest album, titled  'Vs. Children,' was released. Although vocally very similar to his earlier work, the album features a greater variety of acoustic instruments and further demonstrates Ashworth's interest in pursuing more complex arrangements for his songs. His live shows reflect this as on his most recent tour he is joined by a full band.\n\nIn 2010 Ashworth announced that he was retiring the \"Casiotone for the Painfully Alone\" name, as well as the songs he wrote under that name. He now preforms as Advance Base and a producer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Casiotone+for+the+Painfully+Alone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
