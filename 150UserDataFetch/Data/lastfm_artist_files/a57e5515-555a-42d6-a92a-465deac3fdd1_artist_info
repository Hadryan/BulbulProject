The band was fronted by guitarists/vocalists Ash Bowie and Dave Brylawski. Eddie Watkins played drums, and Steve Popson played bass guitar.  The band reformed in 2008 with Brian Quast assuming drum duties. Their sound is defined by complex and dissonant guitar harmonies and driving rhythm, complementing cryptic, often surrealist lyrics. Their music was considered unpredictable and angular and sometimes the guitarists were accused of failing to play with correctly tuned guitars. Polvo's songs and artwork frequently featured Asian/\"exotic\" themes and references. The band's name means \"dust\" in Spanish. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Polvo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
