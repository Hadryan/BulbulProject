Originating from Dayton, Ohio, Sun recorded prolifically for Capitol Records from 1976 to 1984, but just couldn't score a major hit. The closest they came was Sun Is Here, which made it to number 18 on the R&B charts in 1978. They made one last try with Air City in 1984, but it flopped.\n\nOriginal Group Members/Instrument played:\n\n    * John Wagner (Trumpet, Vocs)\n    * Chris Jones (Trumpet, Vocals)\n    * Byron M. Byrd (Tenor Saxophone, Vocals)\n    * Dean Hummons (Organ, Piano, Clavinet)\n    * Hollis Melson ([Bass]])\n    * Kym Yancey (Drums)\n    * Shawn Sandridge (Guitar and Heil Talk Box)\n\nIn 1977, Sun added Gary King (trombone, vocs), Ernie Knisley (percussion, Trumpet), and Bruce Hastell (guitar). In 1979, Robert Arnold, Nigel Boulton, Sonnie Talbert, Keith Cheatham, and Curtis Hooks replaced all but Byron Byrd and Kym Yancey from the original 7 piece lineup,following a management dispute. Founding members Sandridge, Jones and Hummons left Sun to form a new group called Dayton. Sun disbanded in 1982 after a stint in Japan. In 1985 an amended line-up recorded the album 'Eclipse' for the Air City label. By this time Sun's line-up was down to Byron M. Byrd and Anthony Thompson.\n\n6) Sun was an Alternative rock band from Mönchengladbach, Germany with English lyrics and styles described as Crossover and Progressive rock.\n\nThe band was founded in 1991 by Ralf Aussem and Jörg Schröder. Sun was considered for long time on critics as \"German answer\" of Pearl Jam or Tool. Furthermore the band supported Pearl Jam on their Ten Release Tour in 1992 and also Monster Magnet in the year 1995.\n\nTwo years after founding their band they got their Majordeal on the label Gun Records. The band became good known by their albums Murdernature, XXXX and Nitro as also by co-projects for sequels of the serial rock sampler Crossing All Over. Further, the band used instruments atypical of rock, like English flutes.\n\nIn the year 2001 the band split up after different exchanges of bandmembers and severe illness of their singer. Their founder and musicwriter Ralf Aussem plays currently in the Scottish/German band Dead Guitars. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sun\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
