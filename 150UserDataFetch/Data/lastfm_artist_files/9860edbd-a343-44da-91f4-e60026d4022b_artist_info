American have released an edgy new track bound to be heard in afterparties across the underworld\" vibes of Röyksopp - MXDWN \n\nGLISS have enjoyed touring w their friends: The Horrors, Raveonettes, BRMC, Glasvegas, Editors and many more.\n\nGLISS\nInhabiting electronic realms slightly outside of pop, Gliss pour their collective musical imaginations into recording timeless art pop with a precise Scandinavian texture.\nThe Danish/American duo, have been dividing their time between Berlin, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen. Finishing the new recordings in Berlin, Gliss' new music reflects the city's night life and limitless art scene and takes on a darker and edgier sound, while keeping a solid pop structure. This is a band that knows their sound, and having toured with the likes of The Horrors, Raveonettes and Editors, as well as performing for the royal family of Denmark , they clearly have the credentials. \nWhile they are principally known for producing and mixing their own music, the multi-instrumentalists Victoria Cecilia and Martin Klingman have also worked with Gareth Jones for mixing, who is known for his collaborations with Nick Cave, Depeche Mode, and These New Puritans.\n\n\nLangsom Dans -\nDanish/American band Gliss makes a huge departure from their old sound on the new record Langsom Dans which is gathering comparisons to Beach House, Crystal Castles and Lower Dens. The LA based duo, consisting of Victoria Cecilia & Martin Klingman, pour their collective musical imaginations into recording timeless art pop with a precise Scandinavian texture that steps away from their previous work. The 12-track LP features heavy synths and electronic beats with Danish expatriate, Victoria Cecilia, stepping into the role as lead singer. The passionate vocal harmonies dictate the recordings with stories of coming out of the darkness into a new life, bringing to mind The XX, Portishead and Depeche Mode.\n\nThis is a full-length from a band that knows their sound, and having toured with the likes of The Horrors, Raveonettes and Editors, they clearly have the credentials.\n\nThe album is released through Modern Outsider and is already climbing into the Top 5 on the alternative specialty radio charts.\n\nmembers:\nVictoria Cecilia\nMartin Klingman\nDavid Reiss\n\nGliss is set to release their much anticipated new album \"LANGSOM DANS\" in Jan 2013 / mixed by Michael Patterson (Beck, Ladytron, The Social Network) / Mastered by Henrik Jonsson (Fever Ray, Lykki Li, Peter Bjorn & John)\n\n\nReleases:  \nMirrored - Single 2015 Jan 13th\nLangsom Dans CD/LP/Digi\nHunting EP CD/Digi\nDevoted & Imploded CD/Digi - Limited Edition \nDevotion Implosion CD/LP/Digi\nKick in your Heart EP\nBlue Sky single\nRugby Road single\nLove the Virgins Album (WEA)\n\nGLISS release date Nov 2nd 09 UK/Europe \"DEVOTION IMPLOSION\" mixed by Gareth Jones\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gliss\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
