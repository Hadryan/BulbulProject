The band consists of identical twin sisters Tegan Quin and Sara Quin (born September 19, 1980). Both sisters play the guitar and keyboards, and write their songs. They tour with a backing band and they're notorious for their stage banter.\n\nThe duo has released eight studio albums so far: Under Feet Like Ours (1999), This Business of Art (2000), If It Was You (2002), So Jealous (2004), The Con (2007), Sainthood (2009), Heartthrob (2013), and Love You to Death (2016). They also issued the live album/DVD Get Along in 2011.\n\nTegan and Sara initially played as Plunk in 1995, and lacked a drummer and bass player. In 1997, they used their school’s recording studio to record two demo albums: Who's in Your Band? and Play Day. \n\nIn 1998, they made an early breakthrough by winning Garage Warz Battle of the Bands, a local music competition in Calgary. Since then, the two have toured with Neil Young, Rufus Wainwright, Kaki King, The Pretenders, Ben Folds, The Killers, Rachael Cantu, Vivek Shraya, Cake, Gogol Bordello, Hot Hot Heat, Ryan Adams, Veda Hille, Little Birdy, Iron On, Little Brazil, Bryan Adams, and Weezer, and they performed a show at Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair.\n\nThey are signed to Neil Young's Vapor Records in Canada, and to Sire in the United States as their previous label, Sanctuary Records, is no longer releasing new music in the United States. \n\nWhen they were competing in Garage Warz, they were known as \"Sara and Tegan\" because that is how their mother registered them on the competition forms. Their first album, Under Feet Like Ours, was initially released under the name \"Sara and Tegan\". While both twins are similarly involved in vocals and playing instruments, the singing of the lead melody usually goes to whichever twin wrote the particular song. The two hardly sang together in the recordings of their early records, but they started to more on their later records and when live.\n\nOn their 2004 album, So Jealous, the two lend their unusual voices and simple guitar riffs to power pop ballads about love and emotional, haunting songs such as \"Walking With a Ghost\". \n\nThe fifth album, The Con, released July 24, 2007, showed a shift in style towards darker tunes compared to the relatively upbeat indie pop of So Jealous. The singles \"Back in Your Head\", \"The Con\" and \"Call It Off\" were issued to support the album. The twins toured the album for over a year and a half.\n\nTheir sixth studio album, entitled Sainthood, was released on October 27th, 2009, to generally positive reviews. The album included the singles \"Hell\", \"Alligator\", \"On Directing\" and  \"Northshore\".\n\nTegan and Sara also collaborated with many other artists, including Tiësto for the single \"Feel It in My Bones\" (from the album Kaleidoscope, 2009), and Morgan Page for the single \"Body Work\" (from the album In the Air, 2012).\n\n\"Closer\", the first single from their seventh album was produced by Californian pop producer Greg Kurstin. The song was made available for download September 25, 2012. On 29 January 2013, Tegan and Sara released their seventh studio album, Heartthrob.\n\nThe current live touring band members include Ted Gowans (guitar; 2004-present), Jasper Leak (bass; 2012-present), John Spence (keyboards; 2012-present), and Adam Christgau (drums; 2013-present). Former live touring band members include Johnny Andrews (drums; 2006-2010), Shaun Huberts (bass; 2007-2010), Dan Kelly (bass; 2007), Chris Carlson (bass; 2001-2005), Rob Chursinoff (drums; 2001-2005) and Jason McGerr (drums; 2012).\n\nOfficial site: http://www.teganandsara.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tegan+and+Sara\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
