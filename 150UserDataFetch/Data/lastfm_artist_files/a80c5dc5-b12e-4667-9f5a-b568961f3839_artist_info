One year later, the duo return to satisfy fan demand, and their own creative urges, as Run The Jewels, cementing their musical alliance with a full album of uncompromisingly raw, forward thinking hip-hop. \n\nThey released their self-titled debut album, Run the Jewels, on June 26 2013, via Fool's Gold Records to critical acclaim.\n\nTheir follow-up record, Run the Jewels 2, was announced in August 2014. It was released through Mass Appeal Records, on October 24, 2014. They also announced the release of a traditional remix album of Run the Jewels 2, which will be released via Fool's Gold Records Records in 2015, and a remix album titled Meow the Jewels exclusively featuring \"cat sounds\" which will see guest production from Prince Paul, The Alchemist, Just Blaze, Dan the Automator, and others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Run+the+Jewels\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
