He attended Lincoln College Preparatory Academy High School in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was voted class clown three years in a row. After marrying at age sixteen, he divorced a year later. Griffin has one child, Eddie Jr., born in 1986. He first got a taste of comedy when he was a busboy at Stanford and Son's comedy club. He later performed during the open mic night and quickly became recognized as a comedian.\n\n[edit] Career\n\nHe has starred in films such as Double Take (2001), Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), Undercover Brother (2002), Scary Movie 3 (2003), and Norbit (2007). He also starred in the UPN television series Malcolm & Eddie (1996-2000). In addition to his acting credits, he also performed on two tracks from Dr. Dre's 1999 album, 2001. He also has appeared on commercials for Miller Beer's Man Laws. He was considered as well to be a talented standup comic, displaying a flamboyant, cinematic style. Eddie was set to star alongside Steven Seagal in Once Upon A Time In The Hood a thriller set in New Mexico.\n\nHe was number 64 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. Eddie's official fan club website can be found online at: http://www.eddiegriffin.tv. He suffered a heart attack after doing the salsa dance for a taping of his show Malcolm and Eddie.\n\n[edit] Publicity\n\nGriffin crashed a rare Enzo Ferrari while practicing for a charity racing event on March 26, 2007.[1] Following the event, Griffin left the car unharmed and joked about his inability to drive(referring to himself in the third person with pseudonym \"Undercover Brother\" as he also does in the film). The Enzo belonged to film producer Daniel Sadek, writer and producer of the film Redline, a film Griffin is in, which bears the car on its promotional poster. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eddie+Griffin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
