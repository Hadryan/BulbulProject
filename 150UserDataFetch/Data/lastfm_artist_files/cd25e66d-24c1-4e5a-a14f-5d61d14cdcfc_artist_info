More recently, they again collaborated with Beck on the album Guero, and worked with Tenacious D on their self-titled debut.\n\nIn 1998, the duo was approached by director David Fincher to assemble the acclaimed score for the film, Fight Club.\n\nJohn King teamed with Medeski Martin & Wood to create their 2004 album End of the World Party (Just in Case). King also recently worked on the 2005 Garbage album Bleed Like Me. His production work on 'Bad Boyfriend' made it on the album, but his work on tracks 'Space Can Come Through Anyone' and 'It's All Over But The Crying' were respectfully relegated to B-side status and unreleased.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers initially called themselves as \"The Dust Brothers\", after the noted US production duo of the same name, but their burgeoning popularity and the threat of legal action from the originals led them to change their name in 1995.\n\n* Official website\n* Fan database <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dust+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
