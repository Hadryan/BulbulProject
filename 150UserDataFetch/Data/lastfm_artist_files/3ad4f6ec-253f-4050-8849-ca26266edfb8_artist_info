They are also notorious for singing controversial songs involving bestiality, prostitution and blasphemy.\n\nThe Tiger Lillies were originally buskers, playing songs about the criminals, pimps and whores of Soho, London, England. Over time, the band became involved in several theatrical productions around the world, including the critically acclaimed Shockheaded Peter. Known for their intense, outlandish, and dark performances, they have garnered both controversy and critical acclaim.\n\n\nAlso \"The Tiger Lillies\", \"The Tigerlilies\" and \"The Tigerlillies\" may refer to Indie rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio that formed in 1989.\n\nBio: \nCincinnati's power pop stalwarts the Tigerlillies formed in 1989 and set out to fuse glam rock, roots rock, and post-punk into an aesthetic they called \"More Pop than Jesus.\" Led by vocalist/guitarist Pat Hennessy, the band also included former members of the Chrome Cranks, the Candy Snatchers, and G.G. Allin & the Murder Junkies before settling on the lineup of Hennessy, guitarist/vocalist William Weber, bassist Brian Driscoll, and drummer/vocalist Steve Hennessy.\n\nDiscography:\nDeep (1992)\nSpace Age Love Songs (1997)\nCeci N'est  Ces Pop (2003)\n\nhttps://facebook.com/TheTigerliliesUSA/\nhttps://myspace.com/tigerliliesusa <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Tiger+Lillies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
