The Secret Handshake) has penned and recorded scores of songs by himself. His signature electronic-pop sound landed him the sort of success many in the indie circuit could only wish for.\n\nBut for his latest full-length, Dubuc wasn’t going to find himself recording another batch of similar tracks. Enter Night & Day, As Dubuc quite succinctly describes Night & Day, “it’s a Motown record, man.” \n\n“I wanted to take a chance,” Dubuc continues. “I wanted to take a risk on this record. I want to challenge people. I feel like it’s a special record. I feel like it has the potential to really move people to make people feel good about situations in their lives. It’s a soul record. I wanted an authentic sound with the new style.\"\n\n“My voice is still very much 2010 but the music is very much Motown… If there’s ever all-encompassing Motown revival record, this is it.” \n\nLatest news, tour dates and merch can be found at http://www.thesecrethandshake.net. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Secret+Handshake\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
