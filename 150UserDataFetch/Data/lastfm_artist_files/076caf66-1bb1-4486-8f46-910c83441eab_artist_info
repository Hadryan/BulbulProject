Very soon, Stephane Sirkis, Nicola's brother got involved in the band and composed most of their hits in which Nicola always took the leading vocals.\nThey gave their first concert at \"Le Rose bonbon\", a café in Paris on 29 September 1981. This brief performance on stage earned them their first contract with a record company.\nThey recorded their first single in November 1981. It included two songs, Dizzidence Politik and Françoise. Their most known song is \"l'aventurier\" (french for \"adventurer\") which has been covered by Nada Surf. As of 2006 they have released 11 albums and have had several member line up changes through the years. They are very famous in french-speaking Europe and Canada. Indochine has worked with important people in music such as Brian Molko, David Bowie, Robert Smith and  Melissa Auf Der Maur.\nhttp://www.indo.fr/\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Indochine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
