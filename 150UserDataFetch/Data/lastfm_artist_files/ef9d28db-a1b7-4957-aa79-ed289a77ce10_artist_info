But there's also a dreary sparseness, a David Lynch-esque darkness, culled from the other members' native Washington.\n\nThe band's skeletal sound began to take shape, with Robert's rust-belt guitar parts lending a restless, sinister edge to Molly's subdued melodies and soft vocal style. Writing became a collaborative effort, and Widowspeak racked up an arsenal of songs. By fall the trio had recorded a six-track cassette using only a built-in laptop microphone and Garageband. The self-released October Tape, as it was called, fell into the hands of Brooklyn's Captured Tracks. Weeks later, after only their sixth show, Widowspeak recorded the 7\" single Harsh Realm, in anticipation of a full LP. \n\nTheir eponymous debut LP was released on August 9th, 2011 on Captured Tracks.\n\nhttp://widowspeak.bandcamp.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Widowspeak\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
