They rarely use guitars. Instead their soundscape is dominated by piano, cello, violin, electrically-distorted saw, organ, drums and percussion. A somewhat different vein of post-rock, infused with jazzy, folky and classical elements. An important part of the music is also the voice of Henriette Sennenvaldt, whose poetic Danish lyrics add a further mysterious allure to the mix. \n\nThe 1999 debut album \"Kyst\" impressed music critics, who applauded the band for creating their own style and tone. The second album \"Det er mig der holder træerne sammen\" (2002) was equally praised and has grown to become a hallmark for the band and helped reach a wider audience in Denmark and elsewhere. In 2004 it was re-released outside Denmark.\n\nIn 2006 the band released their album \"Af Samme Stof Som Stof\" to rave reviews.\n\nFar from being a mainstream act Under Byen has nevertheless attracted a growing devoted fan base following the release of their two albums and intense live shows.\n\nUnder Byen's influences are very diverse. Leadsinger Henriette Sennenvaldt has been quoted as saying she was inspired by traffic. And if \"Kyst\" would be said to have a theme it would probably be water and harbours. They rarely cite any direct musical influences, but on occasion band members have expressed their fondness for artists such as Stina Nordenstam, Björk, Tori Amos, Sigur Rós, Tom Waits, Mogwai, Mark Hollis and Talk Talk. The band also have strong similarities with Portishead\n\nThey are from Aarhus, Denmark.\n\nMembers\n\n    * Henriette Sennenvaldt – vocals, lyricist\n    * Rasmus Kjær Larsen – pianos\n    * Nils Gröndahl – violin, saw, lapsteel, a variety of guitar pedals\n    * Morten Larsen – drums\n    * Sara Saxild – bass\n    * Anders Stochholm – percussion, accordion, harmonica, guitar\n    * Stine Sørensen – drums, percussion\n    * Morten Svenstrup – cello\n\nFormer members\n\n    * Katrine Stochholm – composer, melodica, backing vocals, piano\n    * Myrtha Wolf – cello\n    * Thorbjørn Krogshede – composer, piano, bass clarinet\n\nhttp://www.underbyen.dk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Under+Byen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
