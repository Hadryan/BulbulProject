While undergoing the writing process of their first ever release, the duo invited Alfredo Notarloberti, the notorious napolitan violinist, to take their side in this ambitious project. With the line-up complete, the band recorded eleven songs out of which seven were selected and included on the demo \"For My Sun\", self-released in May'99. The remarkable energy and empathy between these musicians granted them an appearance as the opening track on Energeia's compilation “Intimations of Immortality Vol. 5” with the song \"Spirit of the Rising Moon\", and drew some media attention to this emmerging band. Shortly after, Ashram signs with the French label Prikosnovenie.\n\nIn 2001, the line-up is expanded as Leonardo Massa joins the group on cello, thus completing the ensemble that would participate in the recording of the critically acclaimed debut self-titled album released in the following year. This new release was followed by intense live activity, as the band performed innumerous shows in Italy and even a couple of tours in Portugal. In 2006 they've released their second full-length album \"Shining Silver Skies\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ashram\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
