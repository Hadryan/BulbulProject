The name of the group, \"Boogie Down\", derives from the alternative name for The Bronx section of New York City.\n\nWhile Criminal Minded was basically about sex and crime, BDP radically changed after Scott's death, becoming the most popular conscious rap group besides Public Enemy. Boogie Down Productions pioneered the fusion of Raggamuffin and hip hop music.\n\nThe membership of BDP changed continuously throughout its existence, the only constant being KRS-One. BDP members and collaborators included Kenny Parker (KRS' brother), Run, Keith Murray, McBoo, Ms. Melodie, Scottie Morris, Willie D., Robocop, Harmony, DJ Red Alert, DJ Jazzy Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah, and Sidney Mills. BDP as group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name, rather than the group name.\n\nAlbums\nCriminal Minded (1987)\nBy All Means Necessary (1988; RIAA Certification: Gold)\nGhetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop (1989; RIAA Certification: Gold)\nEdutainment (1990; RIAA Certification: Gold)\nLive Hardcore Worldwide (1991)\nSex and Violence (1992)\n\nCompilations\nMan & His Music (Remixes from Around the World) (1997)\nBest of B-Boy Records (2001)\n\nSingles\n\nFrom Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop:\n1989: \"Why Is That\"\n\nFrom Edutainment:\n1990: \"Love's Gonna Getcha\"\n\nFrom Sex and Violence:\n1992: \"Duck Down\"\n1992: \"13 & Good\"\n1992: \"We in There\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Boogie+Down+Productions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
