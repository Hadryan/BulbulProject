The single \"Keep Forgetting\" was released from the album the previous month, and the album included the band's previous singles, \"Chase\" and \"Break\". In 2008, TVT Records announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and The Cinematics were one of a small handful of TVT artists whose contracts were retained by The Orchard, who purchased TVT's assets and back catalog.  The Orchard released the band's second album, \"Love and Terror\" in September 2009. Two singles, \"Love and Terror\" and \"New Mexico\", were released from the album.\n\n2.
