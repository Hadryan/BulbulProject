Manos plays wurlitzer piano, melodica, toy piano, ukulele, accordion and does the programming, while George plays some guitar shaped toy synth, mandolin, zither, glockenspiel and hits random objects in his rythmic kit. The project emerged from members of the postrock band “Shortcat” in late 2006, giving them the opportunity to express their love to acoustic instruments, french folk songs and street musicians. With a constantly growing collection of custom-toy instruments and machines, “Your Hand In Mine” act as live-looping based duet, willing to present a new-romantic, deeply personal sense of chamber music.\n\nBeing strongly impatient, in January 2007, they released their first recordings in 100 totally handmade cd copies. The self titled EP, having references to modern west-european folk music and experimentation, defines the band’s aesthetics and identity.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, after being commissioned by the “independent days” section of Thessaloniki’s International Film Festival (T.I.F.F.), they composed original score for Mikio Naruse’s silent masterpiece “Every Night Dreams” (“yogoto no yume, 1933”). The soundtrack was presented as a live accompaniment of the film’s screening during the 48th T.I.F.F, while the following spring (May of 2008), it was distributed by “Inner Ear” label of Patras.\n\nYour Hand in Mine keep enriching their sound palette with new timbres and, in spring of 2011, they come back with a new record. Nine sonic novels, nine small stories told in a fictionary garden, are transcribed into musical notes, composing their second album, which is entitled “The Garden Novels”. This album was released in September 2011, in both cd and vinyl format also by Inner Ear (updated: June 2012). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Your+Hand+in+Mine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
