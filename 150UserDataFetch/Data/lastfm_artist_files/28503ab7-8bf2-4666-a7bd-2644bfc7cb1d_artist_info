Though a number of lineup changes followed, including Portnoy's departure in 2010, Petrucci and Myung remain today along with James LaBrie, Jordan Rudess and Mike Mangini.\n\nThe band has had moderate mainstream success, notably with Pull Me Under in the early 1990s, which received extensive MTV rotation. Dream Theater's (commonly abbreviated 'DT') three highest selling albums are the gold selling Images and Words (1992), despite it reaching only #61 on the Billboard 200 charts, and Awake (1994) which reached #32 on the Billboard 200. Systematic Chaos entered US Billboard 200 at #19.  Black Clouds and Silver Linings reached #6 on the Billboard 200 Charts.  On November 30, 2011, the album's lead single, \"On the Backs of Angels\", was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination. Dream Theater's self-titled twelfth studio album was released on September 23, 2013 and earned their second Grammy Award nomination, this time for “Best Metal Performance”, for the album's first single, \"The Enemy Inside\".\n\nDream Theater has sold over two million albums in the U.S., and over 8 million albums and DVDs worldwide.\n\nIn January of 2005, the band obtained their first United States platinum disc (representing 100 000 DVDs sold) with Live At Budokan, recorded April 2004 in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nThe band released an album entitled Systematic Chaos, their ninth studio album, in collaboration with their new label Roadrunner Records. The album is available in two formats, first one being just a regular edition CD and the other being a CD/DVD album with the entire album mixed in 5.1 surround sound and also \"Chaos in Progress - The Making of Systematic Chaos\" (a 90-minute documentary directed by Mike Portnoy).\n\nThe band is well-known for the technical proficiency of each instrumentalist, winning many awards from music magazines. They are highly respected by many of rock and metal's biggest names, leading to collaborations between Dream Theater members and many other well known musicians. In a famous example, guitarist John Petrucci was named as the third player on the G3 tour with Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, following in the foot steps of Eric Johnson, Robert Fripp, and Yngwie Malmsteen.\n\nDream Theater is also noted for their musical versatility and the many different genres their music incorporates, which has made it possible for them to perform with a very diverse range of acts. Some of their more notable touring partners include Deep Purple, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Iron Maiden, Joe Satriani, King's X, Marillion, Megadeth, In Flames, Pain of Salvation, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Queensrÿche, Spock's Beard, Fear Factory, Enchant, Symphony X, Yes, Big Wreck, I Mother Earth and Fates Warning.\n\nCurrent members:\n* James LaBrie - Vocals, percussion (1991 - present)\n* John Myung - Bass, Chapman Stick (1985 - present)\n* John Petrucci - Guitars, backing vocals (1985 - present)\n* Mike Mangini - Drums, percussion (2010 - present)\n* Jordan Rudess - Keyboards, lap steel guitar, Continuum (1999 - present)\n\nFormer members:\n* Chris Collins - Vocals (1985-1986)\n* Charlie Dominici - Vocals (1987- 1990)\n* Kevin Moore - Keyboards (1985-1994)\n* Derek Sherinian - Keyboards (1994-1998)\n* Mike Portnoy -Drums, percussion, backing vocals (1985-2010)\n\nStudio albums and EPs:\n1989 - When Dream and Day Unite\n1992 - Images and Words\n1994 - Awake\n1995 - A Change of Seasons (EP)\n1997 - Falling into Infinity\n1999 - Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory\n2002 - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\n2003 - Train of Thought\n2005 - Octavarium\n2007 - Systematic Chaos\n2009 - Black Clouds & Silver Linings\n2011 - A Dramatic Turn of Events\n2013 -  Dream Theater\n2016 -  The Astonishing\n\nSingles:\n1992 - Pull Me Under\n1992 - Another Day\n1994 - Lie\n1994 - The Silent Man\n1997 - Hollow Years\n2000 - Through Her Eyes\n2003 - As I Am\n2007 - Constant Motion\n2009 - A Rite of Passage\n2009 - Wither\n\nLive albums:\n1993 - Live at the Marquee\n1998 - Once in a LIVEtime\n2001 - Live Scenes From New York\n2004 - Live at Budokan\n2006 - Score: 20th Anniversary World Tour Live with the Octavarium Orchestra\n2008 - CHAOS in Motion\n\nOfficial Bootlegs (from Ytse Jam Records):\n1985-1986 - The Majesty (Demo)\n1987-1989 - When Dream And Day Unite Demo (Demo)\n1989-1991 - Images and Words Demo (Demo)\n1994 - Awake Demo (Demo)\n1995 - Tokyo, Japan (10/28/95) (Live)\n1996 - Old Bridge, New Jersey (12/14/96) (Live)\n1999 - The Making of Scenes From a Memory (Studio Recordings)\n2002 - The Number of the Beast (10/24/02) (Live)\n2002 - Master of Puppets (02/19/02) (Live)\n2004 - When Dream and Day Reunite (03/06/04) (Live)\n2005 - Dark Side of the Moon (10/25/05) (Live)\n2007 - Made in Japan (Live)\n\nInternational Fan Club Releases (Christmas CDs):\n1996 - Christmas CD\n1997 - The Making Of Falling Into Infinity (Studio Recordings)\n1998 - Once In A LIVEtime Outtakes\n1999 - Cleaning Out The Closet\n2000 - Scenes From A World Tour\n2001 - Four Degrees Of Radio Edits\n2002 - Taste The Memories\n2003 - Graspop 2002\n2004 - A Sort Of Homecoming\n2006 - A Walk Beside The Band\n\nIt may also be noted that Dream Theater's previous name was Majesty, after the band listened to the song Bastille Day by Rush and described it as being majestic. However, this name was short-lived as another band were performing and recording under the same name. So, they re-named themselves Dream Theater after a small cinema which was close to where drummer Mike Portnoy's father was living at the time. The name Majesty is the source of the band's \"M\" logo appearing on the cover artwork of several albums. The Dream Theater song entitled \"Ytse Jam\" is \"Majesty\" backwards and \"Ytse Jam\" is also the name of Mike Portnoy's record label.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.dreamtheater.net/\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
