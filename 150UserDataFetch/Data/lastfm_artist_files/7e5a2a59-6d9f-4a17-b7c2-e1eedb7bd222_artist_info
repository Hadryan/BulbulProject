Her music is an eclectic mix of styles which she described herself as \"ADD music\", because it shifts frequently and dramatically. She fuses contemporary instrumentation with classical vocal practices.\n\nBoucher was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. She graduated from Lord Byng Secondary School and studied ballet for 11 years. In 2006, she moved to Montreal, Canada to attend Montreal's McGill University, studying Russian literature and later, neuroscience. During her studies, she began to record and perform under the name Grimes. While in Montreal, she began attending concerts put on by local experimental musicians at Lab Synth√®se, a performance space located in an abandoned textile factory. She stopped going to McGill and decided to pursue her long life dream of becoming an electronic musician. \n\nHer first release was the album Geidi Primes, issued on cassette in 2010 by Arbutus Records. It was followed in the same year by the sophomore album Halfaxa, through Arbutus Records. In 2011, Grimes released a split album with d'Eon titled Darkbloom.\n\nIn January 2012, she had signed with record label 4AD. In February 2012, Grimes released her third studio album, Visions. The album incorporates influences as wide as Enya, TLC and Aphex Twin, drawing from genres like New Jack Swing, IDM, New Age, K-pop, Industrial and glitch. \n\nVisions was met with critical acclaim and featured on many Best Albums of 2012 lists. The Guardian named Visions the second best album of 2012, calling it \"a masterpiece in gonzo pop that is weird, original and derivative at the same time\". The NME ranked the album at number two on its 50 Best Albums of 2012 list, while naming her best known songs \"Oblivion\" and \"Genesis\" the sixth and sixteenth best tracks of 2012, respectively.\n\nGrimes herself cited various musicians as influences, including Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, Cocteau Twins, How to Dress Well, Swans, Outkast, K-pop, medieval music, industrial music.\n\nOfficial site: www.grimesmusic.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Grimes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
