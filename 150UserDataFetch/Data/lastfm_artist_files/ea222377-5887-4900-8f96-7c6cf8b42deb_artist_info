Her father Talat Tekin was a prominent Turkologist at UC Berkeley. The Tekins moved to Turkey when she was four years old. Özlem grew up in Ankara, where she went on to study classical western music at the Hacettepe University Music Conservatory in Ankara, specializing in the clarinet.\n\nShe started out as the vocalist in \"The Bad.\" The Bad was an underground rock band like most other rock bands and they would perform gigs at clubs, often playing covers from other popular bands. In 1993, she met Şebnem Ferah, who has now also become another recognized rock musician in Turkey, and became the keyboard player of the successful all-female rock band Volvox. Özlem occasionally performed as the lead singer as well.\n\nWhile still in Volvox, she met Hakan Peker and they started working on her debut solo album in 1994. This album, Kime Ne (literally, who cares?), was eventually released in January 1996 to widespread critical acclaim. The first single Aşk Herşeyi Affeder Mi? (Does love forgive everything?) shot to the top of the charts. Other hit tracks include Duvaksız Gelin (Bride without a veil) and Herkes Şanslı Doğmuyor (Not everyone is born lucky).\n\n \nÖzlem Tekin then left Hakan Peker's record label and went to İstanbul Plak (Istanbul Record) which also had acquired other popular singers like Tarkan. Her second album Öz (Pure) was released in February 1998. This spawned Yol (Road) which became an enormous hit.\n\nLaubali (Care-free/Disrespectful) came out a year later to great success.\n\nÖzlem started up her own TV show on Kanal D called Yaz Rüzgarı (Summer Wind) in 2000. This aired for 1 hour, 5 days a week and received high ratings. In year 2003 she started acting in the TV series \"Sil Baştan\" (From Scratch). This show aired for 2 years, also with high ratings.\n\nIn 2005, she starred in the stage musical \"Mucizeler Komedisi\" (The Comedy of Miracles). That very year, her new album \"10987654321\" was released, which presented a much harder sound than her previous effort.\n\nIn 2006 she played in the Cem Yılmaz movie \"Hokkabaz\" (The Trickster).\n\nIn the same year,she also played in the tv movie \"Maçolar\" (Machos).\n\nAfter this experiment, she received a nice surprise, a forest in her honor, owing to her tenth year in music sector. After a long preparation,the forest was completed and named as \"Özlem Tekin-Bahar Ormanı (Özlem Tekin-Spring Forest)\" by her fans.\n\nIn 2007, she played in another TV movie \"Fesupanallah\" (Gosh) and nowadays she is preparing for her new project which is a theatre play \"Kim O\" (Who's That). Özlem Tekin will share the roles with a famous Turkish thespian Metin Serezli in this project.\n\nIn 2008, she started a new TV show in one of the most famous national music channels in Turkey, Kral TV. The show's name is \"Hiperaktif\" (Hyperactive), which is well-suited for Özlem's personality. Özlem is also fully suitable for the program format in her second TV announcer experience after \"Yaz Rüzgarı\" (Summer Breeze).\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Özlem_Tekin <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%C3%96zlem+Tekin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
