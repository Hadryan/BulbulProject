He grew up in a family with Berber and Italian-Spanish origins. Labyala was a troubled child and fairly early on in life he discovered the joys of escapism, inventing his own imaginary world, Klokochazia. His fantasy archipelago of islands was run not by men, but by his own wildest imaginings. And from the age of 14 he began sharing aspects of this world via songs written in a made-up idiom, Klokobetz. Mixing Klokobetz (which has often been compared to Kobaïen, a language invented by the French fusion group Magma in the '70s) with smatterings of English, Nosfell performed in public for the first time at the end of 1999.\n\nNosfell doubles up\n\nIn 2001, following the advice of a musician friend, Nosfell - whose eclectic musical tastes run from Gregorian chants to his idol Neil Young – teamed up with bass-player, 'cellist and committed Bowie fan, Pierre Le Bourgeois. The following year, the pair embarked upon an extensive tour, playing dates in Japan, Canada and the United States. Thus, for the first time, international audiences discovered the weird and wonderful world of Nosfell and his bizarre musical universe made up of vocal pirouettes, rhythmic guitars and on-stage 'mime and movement.'\nThe original young singer-songwriter soon started attracting increasing attention back home in France. Indeed, Nosfell went on to scoop a number of awards, winning two trophies at the \"Tremplin Starting Rock\" (the new talent section of the Chorus des Hauts-de-Seine festival) in 2003 and a breakthrough live act award at the Printemps de Bourges festival in 2004. Six months after Bourges, in November 2004, Nosfell made his debut on the recording front, bringing out \"Pomaïe Klokochazia balek\", an entirely self-financed CD. The album went down well with the public, selling almost 7,000 copies within a few months of its release.\n\n2005, the Year of Nosfell\n\nTour programmers and concert organisers spotted Nosfell's live potential and in the summer of 2005, the zany newcomer found himself performing at major French music festivals such as Les Eurockéennes in Belfort, Les Francofolies in La Rochelle and Les Vieilles Charrues. Meanwhile, Nosfell signed to the V2 label, which re-released his debut album. This time round, critics and record industry professionals picked up on Nosfell's otherworldly sound and he was nominated for the Prix Constantin (an award for best Francophone newcomer of the year). Nosfell ended the year just as he had started it, touring the length and breadth of France. In February 2006, he went on to bring out a live DVD entitled \"Concert à Bruxelles.\" Later that month he flew out to Mexico to record his second studio album, which promises to take listeners on a second trip to the heart of Klokochazia.\nThis second album, \"Kälin bla lemsnit dünfel labyanit\", hit record stores in the autumn of 2006. Written and recorded between Brittany and Mexico, \"Kälin bla lemsnit dünfel labyanit\" featured songs in a mixture of English, French and Klokobetz. Continuing in his wild phantasmagorical vein, Nosfell divided his album into three distinct parts, recounting the adventures of a knight called Günel who conquers a region of Klokochazia. The compositions on the album were courtesy of Pierre Le Bourgeois and featured guest appearances by saxophonist Peter Corser on two tracks and guitarist Bertrand Belin on \"Le long sac de pierres.\" Nosfell embarked upon an extensive tour of France shortly after the release of his second album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nosfell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
