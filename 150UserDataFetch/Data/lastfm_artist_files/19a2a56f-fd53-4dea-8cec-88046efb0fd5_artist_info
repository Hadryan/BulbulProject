musical collaboration from Los Angeles between rock musicians Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan.\n\nDulli and Lanegan have regularly contributed to each other's projects since 2000; of the duo's origins, Dulli said \"I think Mark told a journalist we were doing it, and then the journalist called me, and I didn't know we were doing it.\" On Christmas Day 2003, Dulli and Lanegan began work on the collaboration, titled Saturnalia.\n\nIn July 2007, the music website Pitchfork Media announced that the duo, \"two of the alt-rock era's greatest frontmen,\" had signed to Seattle label Sub Pop. Soon thereafter, Sub Pop reported a 4 March, 2008 release date for Saturnalia. Dulli and Lanegan plan to tour in the United States and abroad to promote the album.\n\nOn September 2, 2008, The Gutter Twins released their eight-song EP Adorata exclusively through iTunes. The EP was mostly recorded during sessions for their first album, Saturnalia.  Adorata features two previously unreleased originals (\"Spanish Doors\" and \"We Have Met Before\") alongside covers of \"Down the Line\" (José González), \"Deep Hit of Morning Sun\" (Primal Scream), \"Duchess\" (Scott Walker), \"Belles\" (Vetiver), \"Flow Like a River\" (Eleven), and \"St. James Infirmary\" (traditional). A portion of the proceeds from the release of Adorata will go to the Natasha Shneider Memorial Fund. Shneider, a long-time friend of the band, was the lead singer for Eleven and a member of Queens Of The Stone Age.\n\nTheir official web presence is located at http://www.theguttertwins.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Gutter+Twins\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
