To then settle for a while in London, where she worked with various musicians such as Keziah Jones, Mick Jagger, Nuspirit Helsinki, The Five Corners Quintet, Shaun Escauffery and more.\n\nGilbert is from Switzerland with Egyptian roots. He started playing guitar at the age of nine. He is a diverse instrumentalist and covers many styles of music, playing guitar, steelguitar, aoud and banjo.

Gilbert has collaborated on movie soundtracks such as \"Someone beside you\" by Edgar Hagen, \"Mein Fuehrer\" by Dani Levy and also writes music for theatre.\n\nTogether, Tatiana and Gilbert are currently working on their first album backed by Universal Publishing France. A folky, soulful breath of fresh air...\n\n...\nIn a few words Okou is:\n\nBetween Tatiana's breathtaking soulful voice and Gilbert's masterful playing of the slide guitar, banjo & anything else with strings, Okou's music really doesn't fit into any category ... soulful blues with an European edge! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Okou\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
