The album was recorded in three weeks at White's own Third Man Studio in Nashville. This group sparks particular interest because Jack White, well known for guitar skills, played drums with this band.. Whiteâ€™s last booking as a drummer was with the Detroit punk outfit Goober and the Peas, aged 19. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dead+Weather\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
