The real trigger happened in the late 80s, when he discovered house. One day in 1997 in Paris, when he was already a fairly famous DJ, he met up with Jean-Louis Costes, who asked him to mix music at his hotel restaurant. Very soon they had the idea of a compilation which could spread worldwide the spirit of the Hôtel Costes, this mythic glamorous place. The first compilation quickly became an undeniable reference. Over a dozen more successful and intense compilations followed. \n\nThen he was asked to deejay everywhere in the world by haute couture designers such as Gucci, actresses like Cameron Diaz, and eventually remixed \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" for Madonna… Yet Stéphane Pompougnac is not only a DJ - he is also an accomplished musician, composing and producing his own songs, which he proved in 2003 with the release of his first album Living On The Edge that featured several talented artists, notably Michael Stipe from REM. Today, Stéphane Pompougnac remains one of the most recognized DJs in the world. \n\nPompougnac released his second album Hello Mademoiselle in early 2006 after his eighth Hôtel Costes compilation.\n\nThe Hôtel Costes series of compilations:\nHôtel Costes, Volume 1: France et Choiseul - (16 tracks) (FR, 1999)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 2: La Suite - (15 tracks) (FR, 1999)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 3: Etage 3 - (15 tracks) (FR, 2000.10.23)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 4 - (14 tracks) (FR, 2001.11.12)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 5 - (15 tracks) (FR, 2002.10.22)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 6 - (14 tracks) (FR, 2003.09.29)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 7 - (16 tracks) (FR, 2004.09.27)\nBest of Costes - (16 tracks) (FR, 2004.12)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 8 - (16 tracks) (FR, 2005.09.26; US 2005.09.27)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 9 - (16 tracks) (FR, 2006.09.25)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 10 - (14 tracks) (FR, 2007.09.24)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 11 - (17 tracks) (FR, 2008.09)\nHôtel Costes, Volume 12 - (16 tracks) (FR, 2009.09.21)\nHôtel Costes: A Decade 1999-2009 - (2 CDs, 28 tracks) (FR, 2009.11.16)\n- Hôtel Costes: A Decade 1999-2009 (disc 1) - (14 tracks)\n- Hôtel Costes: A Decade 1999-2009 (disc 2: Bonus Mix) - (14 tracks)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/St%C3%A9phane+Pompougnac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
