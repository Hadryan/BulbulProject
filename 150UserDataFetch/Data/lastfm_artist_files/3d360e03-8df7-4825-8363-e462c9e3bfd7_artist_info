The line-up was pieced together with the addition of Rebecca Dumican and Rory O'Hara and Michael Repeat. They spent the next few months writing and rewriting songs. Perfectionists to the last, the band waited until that October to begin playing live. This paid off and their live performances quickly gained them a reputation as a band to look out for on the Leeds scene. The inclusion of their track \"The Shipping Forecast\" as the opening track of Leeds label Dance To The Radio's \"Something I Learned Today\" compilation saw them start to gain attention nationwide.\n\nMeanwhile tensions within the band, who openly admit to their fondness for arguments, were making progress difficult and in May 2007 Michael left the band to work on other things, going on to form slacker-rock band Wonderswan.\n\nThe band continued to build on their already formidable reputation; a Japanese EP released in 2007 sold out, as with their debut 7\" release on Dance To The Radio.\n\nAfter a whole month of touring with Bloc Party as part of the \"Bloctober\" Tour, and a hometown stage headline slot at the now infamous Brainwash Festival, Emilia Ergin retired from her position in the band and was promptly replaced by former Mother Vulpine guitarist - Lins Wilson.\n\nDuring October 2009 the band released a new single; Double Negative. After recording demos during their Winter hibernation, Grammatics returned to the live scene with shows in Leeds, York and London in preparation for their sets along SXSW in Austin, Texas. A host of new songs were debuted including; Stalinesque, Mutant Rev, Cedars Sinai, Stankin and Church Of The Great.\n\nIt was announced in July 2010 due to financial problems, that the group were to split, playing final dates in August 2010. A campaign was setup on the independent Pledge Music website where fans could contribute money to the recording and production of a final EP titled Krupt, in exchange for collectors items or a copy/download of the CD.\n\nFinal line-up included:\n\nOwen Brinley - Vocals, Guitar, Sampler, Keys, Omnichord\nLins Wilson - Cello, Vocals\nJames Field - Drums\nRory O'Hara - Bass, Vocals, Keys, Percussion & General on-stage comedy <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Grammatics\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
