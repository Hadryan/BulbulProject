She is named after the actress Bette Davis although Davis pronounced her name in two syllables, and Midler uses one.\n\nDuring her career, she has won four Grammy Awards, four Golden Globes, three Emmy Awards, and a Tony Award, and has been nominated for two Academy Awards. She is currently performing a new concert show, The Showgirl Must Go On, live five nights a week as one of the current headliners at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas (together with Cher and Elton John). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bette+Midler\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
