Playing the drums at the age of 9, he became frustrated with his fellow classmates who could not keep up; he traded his drums at the age of 13 for a computer so he could play all the instruments himself. \n\nAxwell released alot of acidtechno music made with Fasttracker2 in the years of 1995-1997 under the pseudonym Quazar (of Sanxion) and was featured in the intro of the warezgroup Hybrid's crack of the classic computer game Worms 1. During this time he also competed in music competitions, most notably at the demo party Hype in southern Sweden. \n\nDuring the mid-2000s, Axwell rose to prominence as a solo artist. His hit Feel the Vibe was very well received on European dancefloors, and once the track soon picked up support from a host of big DJs it was re-released with a vocal, reaching #16 in the UK charts. Other famous tracks include Watch the Sunrise as well as dance music remixes of Hard Fi’s Hard to Beat and Roger Sanchez’s Turn on the Music.\n\nhttp://djz.com/featured_djs/axwell/\nhttp://www.axwell.nu/\nhttp://www.hype.nu/\nhttp://www.defacto2.net/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Axwell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
