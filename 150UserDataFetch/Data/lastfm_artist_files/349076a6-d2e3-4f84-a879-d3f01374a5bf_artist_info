Ever since she was a child her musical talent was evident, but it was after a visit to London to study drama when, after being invited to a Pat Metheny concert that her life changed. From that moment she began her musical career. During the 1990s she took part in different productions, such as Ombra by La Fura dels Baus and the soundtrack for the Spanish film Km.O. At the same time she composed several songs such as \"Ritmo para voçé\", \"Up to the Sky\", and \"Loving You\" (all of them house successes in Europe).\n\nFrom November 2000 to March 2001 she sang at The Luxor, Harrah's, and Gold Coast casinos in Las Vegas.
