In 1974, he released his first album, titled Benimle Oynar Misin (Would You Play with Me?). He married after releasing this album and concentrated on his family for the next ten years while working as a chemical engineer. \n\nAfterwards, he began collaborating with another prominent Turkish singer-songwriter Fikret Kızılok. This collaboration resulted in the album Pencere Önü Çiçeği (The Flower in Front of the Window) released in 1986. Four years later he released his first solo work after sixteen years: 2. Perde (Second Act), which was followed by Oyuna Devam (Keep On Playing) a year later. In 2000, a tribute album; Bülent Ortaçgil İçin Söylenmiş Bülent Ortaçgil Şarkıları (Bulent Ortacgil Songs, Sung for Bulent Ortacgil) was released with the collaboration of various popular artists. This album remains the first and only tribute album in Turkey made for an artist who is still alive. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/B%C3%BClent+Orta%C3%A7gil\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
