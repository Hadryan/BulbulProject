The album’s first single, “Handle with Grace,” reunites McCluskey with her colleagues from French electropop trio Telepopmusik with incredible results; a video for the track is currently in production with directors Alex Takacs and Joe Nankin of Young Replicant (M83’s “We Own the Sky” video). \n\nAvailable now through iTunes, the album will be available as a physical release on June 8, 2010 through Bernadette Records.\nKnown first for her work with the LA-based group Wild Colonials, it was McCluskey’ s Grammy-nominated dance hit, “Breathe,” recorded with Telepopmusik and picked up by Mitsubishi for use in a popular TV campaign that introduced millions to her earthy, unique voice. Along the way, McCluskey has also supported R.E.M. on tour and performed with everyone from Little Richard to Glasvegas to – most recently – New York City cabaret stars The Citizen’s Band.\n\nTastemaker radio station KCRW has already featured “So Good,” the album’s opening track, as a “Today’s Top Tune” download. McCluskey’s February 19, 2010 performance on KCRW’s “Morning Becomes Eclectic” was so popular it will be available as an iTunes podcast starting March 5 and running for two weeks.\n\nThe album is a collaborative effort that includes the eclectic songstress’s many and various friends: Joseph Arthur, Kraig Jarret Johnson (Golden Smog), Scott McCloud (Girls against Boys), Bardi Johannsson (Bang Gang), Duke B (Gaea), Stephane Haeri (Telepopmusik), Paul Cantelon, Craig Wedren (Shudder to Think), Seth Rothschild, Wild Colonials and Richard Fortus (Guns n’ Roses).\n\nSo far, the positive reviews have been undeniable, with one reviewer saying: “In many ways Angela’s voice is not hers; it’s yours.” Once you hear this amazing album, you’ll have to agree. Stay tuned for performance dates.\n\n“McCluskey …is the anti-diva, the anti-Leona Lewis, the anti-manufactured pop star. And her voice works live just as it does on record, an incredible juxtaposition of the greats: Beth Gibbons, Billie Holiday and Nina Simone. McCluskey eases emotion and soul out of her most personal obsessional ballads with an effortless cool.”\n– Alan McGee, Guardian UK (music legend and founder of Creation Records) \n\nCheck www.angelamccluskey.com\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Angela+McCluskey\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
