Acts like TRIANA, CAI, MEZQUITA and AZAHAR would establish themselves as the preeminent players on these scenes, along with the more contemporary counterparts like LOS CANARIOS and ALAMEDA.\n\n12) VEGA was a German hip-hop duo that released the single Ich chille in 1999.\n\nIn this vein VEGA combined Andalusian instrumentation (and sometimes traditional arrangements) with a less well-defined progressive bent, emphasizing instead a heavy flamenco influence and the showcased guitar work of band leader Tómas Vega. Vega had been a member of the earlier Spanish band LOS GRIMMS, and would also, along with bandmate Jorge Pardo, lend his name to a couple DOLORES (Pedro Ruy Blas) records in the same timeframe.\n\nThe group released three albums in three years, each accompanied by one single. The first two are heavily imbued with flamenco-driven fusion compositions, while the final release 'Sol de Oscuridad' seemed to be more intended as an attempt at commercial success with vocals and repetitive, less original arrangements. The band was already in its death throes by the time the third album released.\n\nVEGA were a minor player in an ample line of Spanish and Andalusian prog bands of the seventies and eighties. While their contributions don't generally rank among the greatest acts of that segment, they are worthy of recognition and inclusion in these ProgAcrhives.\n\n>>Bio by Bob Moore (aka ClemofNazareth)<< (www.progarchives.com)\n\n13)  VEGA is a three-piece heavy stoner rock band hailing from the 'VEGA' star. They traveled the interstellar star-ways of the multiverse in their dark matter-fueled VEGA-van, intent on spreading their riff to passing planets.  Lights years into their journey they happened upon a planet that caught their attention: this planet was unlike any of the other desolate and in some cases, down right primitive planets they had visited since they started their galactic tour. This planet was Earth and they found it akin to their homeland; such as it was cut from the same great cosmic cake as VEGA. It had majestic mountains, vast oceans, extreme deserts, beautiful flowered plains, and industrialized modern cities. All Earth's inhabitants, from intelligent lifeforms to basic single-celled organisms, were identical to VEGA-ns and lived indistinguishable lifestyles and had similar habits to the people of their home-star. Earth even had music: just like VEGA.  VEGA decided to stay on this strangely familiar, yet completely foreign sister-planet and lay down their sweet-star riffs as ambassadors to their beloved VEGA. \nMembers:\nMykel Martinez - Guitar & Vox  \nMax Muenchow - Bass \nAlvin Vega - Drums \nFor more information check their Facebook page, or Bandcamp. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vega\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
