She is also a part of a collective of writers and producers known as The Clutch, and has written hits for many artists including Britney Spears, Usher, Ciara, Ludacris and Omarion,  After performing on Xzibit's hit song Hey Now (Mean Muggin') and Timbaland's album Shock Value she released her debut album, In A Perfect World..., in 2009.

Despite having made a name for herself as an arranger and background vocalist, lending her vocal talents to many of the songs she wrote on, Hilson remained behind the scenes for the most part until 2004, when she was featured on Xzibit's single, \"Hey Now (Mean Muggin)\" and made her performing debut singing the track live at the 2004 MTV Europe Awards.\n\nIn 2006, Hilson reappeared on the music scene in the video for Nelly Furtado's single \"Promiscuous\".

II\" remix) appeared as one of the \"independent women\" in Ne-Yo's music video for \"Miss Independent\" and appeared briefly on Nelly's \"Party People\" music video wearing a T-Shirt with the slogan 'Hip Hop aint dead'. She soon after featured on Nas' debut single from his controversial album Untitled, \"Hero\".\n\nAfter many pushbacks, Hilson's debut solo album In a Perfect World... has now been set for an early 2009 release. The album's first single was \"Energy\" and its music video was released July 14, 2008. \"Energy\" has peaked at a low #78 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nA second single \"Return The Favor\" features Timbaland was released officially as a digital download on October 7, 2008 and the video, directed by Melina, premiered on October 23, 2008. In the meantime, she also featured on Chris Brown's single \"Superhuman\" and Kardinal Offishall's 2008 single \"Numba 1 (Tide Is High)\", which was originally featured Rihanna. This single failed to chart on the Hot 100.\n\nThe track \"Turnin Me On\" features rapper Lil' Wayne and was released as the third official single as a digital download on November 25. The video, which was directed by Erik White after he and Hilson met on the set of the \"Superhuman\" video, premiered on November 20, 2008. \"Turnin Me On\" has so far peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and recently hit #2 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming Hilson's most successful single as well as her first Top 50 single in the U.S..

The song got that much attention that a official remix was made featuring Kanye West, which made the album too. The Suspected third Single is The Way You Love Me and a full length video (short film) appeared on Vevo.
