Humphrey in early 2008, after leaving the now defunct Try Harder Records (Foals, Blood Red Shoes) flagship band \"Tired Irie\"; adding Gavin Thorpe, Daniel Faulkner, singer Adam Pickering and drummer Ben Cropley\nAt their first ever show, supporting Cats and Cats and Cats in Leicester, the band were approached by Tom Woodhead of ¡Forward, Russia! with reference to letting Woodhead record and produce the band. Woodhead would go on to be pivotal in their development.\nThe first EP, titled Minnaars was recorded around April 2008 in Giant Wafer, based in the valleys of Llandrindod Wells, Wales. The recording was completed in a week and was produced solely by Woodhead.[2]\nIn early February 2009, the recordings were made available through the band's websites due to a lengthy disagreement with an independent distributor due to release the record.\nMinnaars returned to Wales in Spring 2009 to record new material, again with Tom Woodhead as producer. The band agreed licences to release these recordings, along with the tracks from Minnaars in Japan and mainland Europe in summer 2009, under the title Of Our Delirious Former Loving Hours, a line from \"Birds in the night\" by poet, Paul Verlaine.\nThe band performed on the BBC Introducing Stage at the 2009 Reading and Leeds Festivals [3] days before embarking on a short European tour with close friends Gallops. They enjoyed heavy coverage of their song \"Are lovers\" from national TV and radio, including BBC Radio 1 and Xfm and were lauded in the national press by Gavin & Stacey star Mathew Horne.\nAs of September 2010 the band began working with Strata Music Group and have announced that an EP, titled \"Ideal & Error\", will be available from January 2011, to coincide with a lengthy European tour.\n2011 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Minnaars\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
