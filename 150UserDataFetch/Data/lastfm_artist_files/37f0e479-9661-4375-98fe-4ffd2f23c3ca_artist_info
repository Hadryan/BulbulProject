It is a mixed unit composed of seventy-five to eighty school-aged children from ten to fifteen years old. All are provided education from the Saint-Marc college in Lyon.\n\nLes Petits Chanteurs acquired recognition with the release of the 2004 film Les Choristes, for which they provided the vocals for the soundtrack. One of the soloists, Jean-Baptiste Maunier was chosen to play a lead role in the film.\n\nThe choir held a performance, entitled Les Choristes en concerte in which they sang a variety of songs, including several from the film. Jean-Baptiste Maunier and Emmanuel Lizé were the boy soloists for the concert. After Maunier's departure from the choir, Lizé moved to first soloist and his prior spot was filled by Rabi Ramadan.\n\n\nIn addition to performances where they sing music from the film, the choir also performs Mozart's opera-comedy, Bastien and Bastienne.\n\nIn 1995, the choir was named the official choir of the Basilica Notre-Dame de Fourvière. The choir performs in France as well as abroad, giving performances in the United States, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom, Lebanon, Japan and more. They also perform at festivals and give their patronage to humanitarian organizations. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Les+Petits+Chanteurs+de+Saint-Marc\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
