He is currently signed to Record Makers.\n\nTellier's first album, L'incroyable Vérité (The Incredible Truth), was released in 2001. Tellier went on tour with Air in support of the album. The track \" Fantino\" off the album was chosen by Sofia Coppola for the soundtrack to her 2003 film \"Lost in Translation\". Tellier followed L'incroyable Vérité with his second studio album Politics (2005). A particularly popular song from Politics was \"La Ritournelle\", a string-led tune, which featured Nigerian drummer, Tony Allen of Fela Kuti fame. \"La Ritournelle\" was remixed by various artists, notably in Britain by Metronomy.\n\nSince the release of Politics, Tellier has also recorded an acoustic album of his more popular songs, Sessions (2006). The album was repackaged for the British market as Universe (2006), to include both highlights from the French CD, as well as compositions from Tellier's score for the film Narco. \nHis third studio album Sexuality was produced by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk. Like his previous album Politics, Tellier used a single term as title and theme of the album. \n\nOn 7 March 2008, it was announced by Bruno Berberes, head of EBU delegation in France, that Tellier would represent France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. It was held in Belgrade on 24 May 2008. Tellier sang \"Divine\". This was the first time in the history of the contest that the nominated French entry was to be performed largely in English, which caused controversy, leading to Tellier pledging to increase the amount of French in the song prior to the competition itself. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/S%C3%A9bastien+Tellier\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
