The song has since also moved to various commercial radio stations and has increased in popularity. In the UK it peaked at number 3. and it reached Number 1 on the Australian ARIA Club Chart as of 12 September 2010. For Billboard magazine week ending December 18, 2010, the song reached the #1 position on the Dance/Club Play Songs chart.
