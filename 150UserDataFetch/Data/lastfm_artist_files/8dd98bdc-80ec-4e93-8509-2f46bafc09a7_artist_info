He was born and grew up in Dumfries, Scotland. His interest in electronic music surfaced in his early teenage years, producing his first bedroom demo by the age of 15. \n\nHis first album I Created Disco was released on 18 June 2007. The album contained up-tempo electroclash songs that were influenced by music from the 1980s. To promote 'I Created Disco', Harris embarked on a tour of the UK, supporting Faithless and Groove Armada.\n\nThe first release from the album was Vegas on limited edition vinyl and the first charted single released from the album was Acceptable In The 80's, a tribute to the style and culture of the decade. The song reached the top ten on the UK singles chart, remaining on the chart for fifteen weeks. The Girls was the album's second charted single. The fourth release from the album was Merrymaking At My Place however it only reached #43 in the UK chart.\n\n'Merrymaking At My Place' caused Harris some un-needed press, as the song and video promoted filming parties at teenagers' houses, and placing them on Youtube.\n\nHarris' second studio album Ready For The Weekend was released on August 17, 2009 in the United Kingdom. The first single, I'm Not Alone, was exclusively performed in Sydney, on New Year's Eve. The single was released in April 2009. The new single debuted on BBC Radio 1 on Friday 23 January 2009, on the 'Pete Tong' radio show. The song featured on his MySpace with the infamous spoiler, which repeated the phrase 'I Am Your Nan' in a robotic voice. It debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #1 on Easter Sunday on downloads alone. \n\nHarris rose to international prominence in 2012 with the release of his third studio album, 18 Months. Topping the UK charts, the album became his first to chart on the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 19.

The latter became an international success, giving Harris his first US number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. Harris released his fourth studio album, Motion, in November 2014. It debuted at at number two in the UK and number five in the US, and became Harris's second consecutive number-one album on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart.

He also became the first British solo artist to reach more than one billion streams on Spotify. Harris has received seven Brit Award nominations—two for Best British Male, and four Grammy nominations, winning a Grammy for Best Music Video in 2013. He received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year in 2013 and at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards was named Top Dance/Electronic Artist.
