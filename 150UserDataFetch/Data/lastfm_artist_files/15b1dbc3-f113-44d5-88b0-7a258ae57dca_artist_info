He has released over 30 albums, singing in Portuguese and traditional Angolan languages. His tracks are a mixture of Portuguese-language folk songs, semba, kizomba and latin elements.\n\nWhile Angola was still a Portuguese colony, Bonga was an outspoken supporter of independence. This led him to be exiled from Angola in the early 1970s. It was during this time that he launched his first album, Angola 72.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bonga\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
