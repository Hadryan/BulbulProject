Besides being the lead vocalist, Renato was an occasional guitar, bass and keyboards player.  He also wrote most of  the band's songs. In 13 years of career, they recorded 13 albums, one for each year.\n\nLegião Urbana is probably one of the most famous Brazilian rock bands, especially known for Renato's poetic lyrics, which range from love and spiritualism to politics, family, sex and drugs.\n\nNowadays, Dado Villa-Lobos (ex-guitar player of Legião Urbana) has a solo career and recorded his first album, named \"Jardim De Cactus\", in 2005. Drum player Marcelo Bonfá also tried a solo career. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Legi%C3%A3o+Urbana\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
