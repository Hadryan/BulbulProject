The album featured Tomas Haake (drummer of Meshuggah ) on \"spoken vocals\", as well as Morgan Ågren on drumkit and Mats Öberg on keyboards, who both have played for \"Mats & Morgan\" and \" Frank Zappa \". The style of music is best described as very a very similar style to Meshuggah's thrashy poly rhythmic Metal with Jazz elements and some obscure noise effects such as high pitched shrieks and screams. \n\nThe album was remixed and re-released by Ultimate Audio Entertainment and Relapse Records in 1999 under the title \"Sol Niger Within version 3.33\". The re-release contains two bonus tracks but omits several parts of the original version, most noticeably, the church organs. The Bonus tracks include \"Missing Time\" and \"Ooo Baby Baby\".\n\nA second solo album is in the works, with the current Soilwork drummer Dick Verbeuren, but a release date is unknown. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fredrik+Thordendal%27s+Special+Defects\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
