Franciotti is also a member of Silver Pines.\n\nSleep ∞ Over was formed in early 2010 in Austin TX. With a few rough demos recorded live on a handheld tape recorder, the band (consisting at the time of Stefanie Franciotti and former members Christa Palazzolo and Sarah Brown) quickly attracted the attention of the esteemed Night People label who released the first Sleep ∞ Over EP on cassette. Although the tape came during a flood of hazy lo-fi releases, Sleep ∞ Over’s melodically-driven aesthetic rose to the top of the saturated genre. Boutique vinyl label Light Lodge also released a song from the Night People tape on a split 7” with fellow Austin band Pure X. In spring 2010, the band pulled their poignant melodies and classic pop song structures out of the murk and released a lush and expansive sounding group of songs on a 7” for Forest Family records which sold out in less than a week.\n\nIn summer 2010, Sleep ∞ Over did East and West Coast tours and continued to build on the intense infatuation that listeners of a wide range of styles seem to have with the band’s fragile yet powerful energy. Everything was in place and it seemed a natural fit that the Hippos in Tanks label would release Sleep ∞ Over’s highly awaited debut LP. However, just prior to the recording session, two members left the band. It would have been very easy for Sleep ∞ Over to dissolve entirely as so many bands tend to do when put under a magnifying glass, but Stefanie Franciotti had no intention of slowing down or even missing a beat.\n\nOfficial site: http://sleepoverforever.tumblr.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sleep+%E2%88%9E+Over\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
