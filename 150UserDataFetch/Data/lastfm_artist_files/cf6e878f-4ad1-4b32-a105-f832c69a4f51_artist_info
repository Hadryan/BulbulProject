He is one of the most successful DIY musicians in Europe\n\nCombining folk with acoustic pop elements and beginning in 2003, Milow released his debut album, The Bigger Picture, in 2006 on his own label Homerun Records. The fourth single from that album, \"You Don't Know,\" became one of the biggest hit singles of the year in Belgium in 2007. \n\nMilow's acoustic cover of 50 Cent's \"Ayo Technology,\" released in 2008, stayed on the charts for over 340 weeks in 14 different countries. The video also went viral on YouTube with over 50 million views. Milow followed the immense success of the single by quickly releasing a self-titled studio album. Three years later, he has sold over 650,000 albums and more than 1.15 million singles.\n\n“North and South,” recorded in Belgium and partially mixed in Los Angeles by two-time Grammy-winner Tony Maserati (Beyonce Knowles, Jason Mraz, Robbie Robertson), was released in 2011. The mastering was done in New York City by Dave Kutch (The Roots, Erykah Badu, Outkast). The video for the first single, “You and Me (In My Pocket),” is available on YouTube.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Milow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
