Two months later, Beach House issued their eponymous debut album for Carpark. Fall shows with labelmates Over the Atlantic were also scheduled.\n\nVictoria can also be heard on Frenemies' Birds in High School album.  She and Chris Freeland created harmonies on the song Waiting for the Ambulance. Victoria can also be heard on Grizzly Bear's 2009 release \"Veckatimest\" and she sings on \"Slow Life\", a Grizzly Bear track featured on the official soundtrack for Twilight: New Moon.\n\nIn September of 2009 Sub Pop Records announced that Beach House had signed and that a follow up album to 2008's \"Devotion\", \"Teen Dream\"  would be released in early 2010.\n\nBeach House was featured as a cover story in a January 2010 issue of the Washington Post magazine.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beach+House\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
