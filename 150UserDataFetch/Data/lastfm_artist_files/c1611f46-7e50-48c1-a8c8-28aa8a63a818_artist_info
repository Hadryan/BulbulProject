Winning his first blues contest at 11, four years later Eric signed to Elektra to issue his 1991 debut LP, recorded with Eugene on bass; Picture of a Thousand Faces followed in 1993. Manuel (who previously performed under the alias Little Jimmy King) reunited with his siblings for 1995's Left Hand Band, credited to the Gales Brothers.\n\nA newly matured Gales returned in spring 2001 to release his debut for MCA, That's What I Am. Often billed as the second coming of Jimi Hendrix, Gales, an adequate singer at best but a dynamite guitarist, suffered for the comparison. With Gales always influenced by Hendrix and the power trio format, his next albums, 2006's Crystal Vision and 2007's Psychedelic Underground, both released by Blues Bureau Records, seemed like facsimile Hendrix albums, right down to the album art. His next two releases from Blues Bureau, 2008's The Story of My Life and 2009's Layin' Down the Blues, found the Hendrix influence muted somewhat, but Gales, a breathtaking guitarist at times, still seemed to be looking for a way out of the Hendrix shadow and into his own voice. Gales returned in 2010 with Relentless, a collection of 13 originals, and followed it with the passionate Transformation a year later in 2011. \n\nEric Gales is a very talented Blues-Rock guitarist and vocalist from Memphis, Tennessee, USA. His music is a fusion of Hard-Rock, Blues and Funk. Eric Gales has released nine studio albums so far, his latest being \"Relentless\".\n\nDiscography\n\n2011 Transformation\n2010 Relentless\n2009 Layin' Down the Blues (compilation)\n2008 The Story of My Life\n2007 Psychedelic Underground\n2006 Crystal Vision\n2001 That's What I Am\n1995 Left Hand Brand\n1993 Picture of a Thousand Faces\n1993 Eric Gales\n1991 The Eric Gales Band  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Gales\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
