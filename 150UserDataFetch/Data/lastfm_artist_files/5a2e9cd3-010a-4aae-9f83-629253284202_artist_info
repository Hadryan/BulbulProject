Her latest album is Are We There (14 May 2014, Jagjaguwar).\n\nShe moved to Tennessee to attend Middle Tennessee State University, where she discovered a variety of influential music. After moving back home to New Jersey, she was encouraged by Kyp Malone of TV on the Radio to pursue a career in music.\n\nSharon van Etten went on her first UK tour with Meg Baird in Jan 2008.  She toured with Great Lake Swimmers on their European tour in May 2009, kicking it off with a show in London with Beirut and Shearwater.  She again toured with them in September/October 2009.\n\nOn May 26th, 2009, she released her \"Because I Was in Love\" single on 12\" vinyl, CD and MP3 on Language of Stone.\n\nShe was the first artist to record in 2010 for the Weathervane Music's Shaking Through video series.\n\nOn September 21, 2010, her sophomore album, \"Epic\" was released on Ba Da Bing. The powerful 7-track album featured much more instrumentation than her first, primarily-acoustic affair.  The evolution of her sound proved that she is much more than a traditional folk singer-songwriter.\n\nThe release of Epic coincided with a difficult break-up of a relationship. She busied herself with touring for the record, but when the singer completed her schedule a year later, she found herself homeless in New York. After a period of sleeping on friends' couches, recovering from her heavy touring schedule, she hooked up the National's guitarist Aaron Dessner to record her third album, Tramp, which was released on February 7th, 2012. \n\nSites: MySpace <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sharon+Van+Etten\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
