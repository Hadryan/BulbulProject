He is known for creating intricate electronic music that is characterized by its emphasis on melody and hypnotic pacing, conceptually stylized structures and extreme use of audio processing techniques. Early incarnations of OPN date back to the mid 2000s and drew heavily on the stylistic forms of cutout bin ambient and new age records, combined with the structure and abrasiveness of noise music. A series of home-recorded cassette and CDR releases interspersed with a number of full-length albums surfaced around 2007, and by 2009, these were compiled on the 5-LP box set ‘Rifts’ which brought him international acclaim. Lopatin then released his next LP Replica on his own imprint, Software. This body of work focused heavily on sample-based composition; intuitively structuring the record's 10 tracks around samples from recorded archives of TV commercials he purchased from a \"nostalgia dealer\" on the internet. Nearly two years later, Oneohtrix Point Never made its Warp debut with R Plus Seven. Inspired by procedural poetry and commercial television soundtrack tropes, the record could be heard as a cryptic meditation on the materiality of sound itself told via Lopatin's increasingly sculptural style of production. Other works have included collaborations with Antony Hegarty on a rendition of the Oneohtrix Point Never song 'Returnal' and a remix of Hegarty's 2012 song 'Swanlights', a remix of the Nine Inch Nails song 'Find My Way', and audio-visual works which have been hosted by The Tate and The Barbican and in London, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and MoMA PS1 in Long Island City. He is said to be writing his followup to R Plus Seven in 2015. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Oneohtrix+Point+Never\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
