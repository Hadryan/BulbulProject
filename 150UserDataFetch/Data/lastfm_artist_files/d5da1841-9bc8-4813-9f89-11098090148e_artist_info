Smith. Smith's lyrics are free, unboxed and unpredictable, touching on an extremely wide range of subjects and places, and caring little for being tied down to easily digestible messages.\n\nSmith's singing can put off some people, but others find it a uniquely expressive instrument. Smith is not a conventionally great vocalist, but his keen sense of rhythm, his energy and personality more than make up for this.\n\nThe Fall's music changes depending on the line-up at a given time. Always experimental, Mark E. Smith has claimed to invent several musical genres, including house music; \"we were doing that years ago\" and even the internet. \"He told me I didn't understand, that we were from the bleak industrial wastes of North England, or something, and that we didn't understand the Internet. I told him Fall fans invented the Internet. They were on  there in 1982.\" One thing that is for sure is that The Fall (and their fans) have always pushed the boundaries, and never been afraid to experiment.\n\nThe Fall were a favorite group of DJ John Peel, recording 24 sessions for his BBC1 radio program over the years. \n\nThe Fall's back catalogue consists of 29 studio albums, and is very fragmented with a seemingly endless number of compilations and semi-official live albums.\n\nIn 2006, British music-critic Dave Simpson published an entertaining account of a journalist's attempt to track down all 43 former members of The Fall in the Guardian. Many previous members have been fired, often with little or no notice. Simpson's ongoing effort was subsequently described at greater length in his book \"The Fallen\" (2008).  His effort to track down the final unaccounted stragglers of at least 50 previous members of The Fall - including drummer Karl Burns - continues in his blog.  Having decried Simpson's book as a \"hatchet job\" in the pages of Pseud. Mag., a Fall fan-mag, Mark E. Smith countered in short order with his autobiography \"Renegade: The Lives and Tales of Mark E. Smith\" (Viking, 2008/Penguin 2009). \n\nKey Albums include:\n\n# Live At the Witch Trials (debut)\n# Dragnet\n# Totale's Turns (It's Now Or Nevr)\n# Grotesque (after the Gramme)\n# Perverted By Language\n# Hex Enduction Hour\n# This Nation's Saving Grace\n# Middle Class Revolt\n# Bend Sinister\n# Extricate\n# The Infotainment Scan\n# Country on the Click aka The Real New Fall LP\n# Fall Heads Roll\n# Reformation Post TLC (new)\nCompilations/Singles/B-Sides:\n\n# 50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong: 39 Golden Greats\n# The Complete Peel Sessions 1978-2004\n# Totally Wired: The Rough Trade Anthology (disc 1) and Totally Wired: The Rough Trade Anthology (disc 2)\n# 458489 A-Sides\n# 458489 B-Sides <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
