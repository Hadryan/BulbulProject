He is best known for his frequent collaboration with director Robert Zemeckis, including composing major hit films such as the Back to the Future trilogy and Forrest Gump, as well as the superhero films Captain America: The First Avenger and Marvel's The Avengers.\n\nSilvestri grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey and attended Teaneck High School. He went to Berklee College of Music for 2 years and is of Italian descent.\n\nSilvestri started his film/television composing career in 1972 at age 21, composing the score for the low-budget action film The Doberman Gang.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1983, Silvestri served as the main composer for the TV show CHiPs, writing music for 109 of the show's 139 episodes.\n\nSilvestri met director Robert Zemeckis when the two worked together on Zemeckis's 1984 film Romancing the Stone. Since then, Silvestri has composed the music for all of Zemeckis's movies, including the Back to the Future trilogy (1985, 1989, 1990), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Death Becomes Her (1992), Forrest Gump (1994), Contact (1997), Cast Away (2000), The Polar Express (2004), Beowulf (2007), A Christmas Carol (2009), and Flight (2012).\n\nSilvestri is also known for his work on Predator (1987) and Predator 2 (1990), both of which are considered preeminent examples of action/science fiction film scores. Since 2001, Silvestri has also collaborated regularly with director Stephen Sommers, scoring the films The Mummy Returns in 2001, Van Helsing in 2004, and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra in 2009.

The show, which is being co-written by original writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, is expected to be performed in 2015, on the 30th anniversary year of the film. Silvestri will team up with Glen Ballard to compose a new score, with the addition of original songs from the film, including \"The Power of Love\", \"Johnny B. Goode\", \"Earth Angel\" and \"Mr. Sandman\".\n\nSilvestri owns a vineyard, Silvestri Vineyards, located in Carmel Valley, California.\n\nSilvestri has received two Academy Award nominations, one for Best Original Score for Forrest Gump (1994) and one for Best Original Song for \"Believe\" on The Polar Express soundtrack. He also received two Golden Globe nominations: Best Score for Forrest Gump and Best Song for The Polar Express.\n\nHe has also received four Grammy Award nominations, winning two awards â€“ Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, for \"Believe\" from The Polar Express in 2004 and Best Instrumental Composition, for \"Cast Away End Credits\" from Cast Away in 2002. His other nomination was for Best Soundtrack Album, for Back to the Future. During the 2005 Grammys, Josh Groban performed \"Believe.\"\n\nHe has won the Saturn Award for Best Music three times, for his scores for Predator (1987), Back to the Future Part III (1989/90) and Van Helsing (2004).\n\nOn September 23, 2011, he was awarded with the Max Steiner Film Music Achievement Award by the City of Vienna at the yearly film music gala concert Hollywood in Vienna.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Silvestri\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
