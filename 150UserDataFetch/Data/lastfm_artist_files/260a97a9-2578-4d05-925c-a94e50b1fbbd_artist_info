Along this female wordsmith's journey, there have been many stops - Philadelphia, China, and Ghana, among others - have all informed the wisdom and perspective which is evident in her music.\n\nWith the release of her debut album, \"The Journey Aflame\", Naru has in a short time positioned herself on the scene as a model for what women can be in hip hop. Since the release, the album has been written about in several countries and deemed a classic hip hop contribution by hip hop critics from New York to Moscow. Placing at number one on the US college radio charts, with the Jr & Ph7 produced single \"The World Is Listening\", Naru has definitely been doing just that, making the world listen. With production accredited to some of Germany's finest names in hip-hop, from production powerhouse Drumkidz, Jr & Ph7, 7inch, and more, \"The Journey Aflame\" has definitely forged its place into hip hop history. With that, Naru reveals that her journey has not only been set aflame; it has just begun.\n\nRepresenting strongly when performing with Digflo, her notorious 6-piece band, or with performances alone with a DJ, Naru has a reputation for captivating audiences, hyping crowds, and inspiring many. Clearly, her music and performances are a testiment to the legacy of soul music and the powerful trailblazing female artist traditon on which it builds. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Akua+Naru\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
