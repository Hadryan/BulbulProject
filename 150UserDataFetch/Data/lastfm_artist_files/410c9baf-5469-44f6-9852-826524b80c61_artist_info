They began by making and trading electro and hip-hop mixtapes, but gradually collected some cheap equipment (most notably a Casio SK-1 Sampler) and moved on to their own compositions.  By the time Warp Records released their debut, Incunabula, they were employing a variety of electronic instruments to create their evolving style.\n\nBooth and Brown have explained that the name Autechre can be pronounced in any way anyone sees fit.  They pronounce it \"aw-TEK-er\" (IPA) /ɔ ˈtɛk ɚ/. \n\nAutechre helped initiate the music festival All Tomorrow's Parties in 2000, and were responsible for curating the 2003 festival. \n\nAutechre utilize a wide array of analog synths in their production as well as analog and digital drum machines and samplers.  They have also made extensive use of a variety of computer based sequencers, softsynths, and other applications, such as Max/MSP. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Autechre\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
