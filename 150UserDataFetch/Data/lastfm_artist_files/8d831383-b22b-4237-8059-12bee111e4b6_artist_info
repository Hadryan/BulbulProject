Adopting the Twin Shadow moniker, he released his debut album, 'Forget', in 2010.\n\nProduced by Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear, the album has been described by critics as \"steeped in 1980s new wave\", \"building from streaks of haunting synth textures\", and full of \"hazily new wave-tinged pop\". Twin Shadow was the Rolling Stone \"Band of the Week\" on October 7, 2010. His 2012 sophomore album, 'Confess', also received strong critical acclaim, featuring the fan-favorite song \"Five Seconds\".\n\nPopmatters spoke for many music critics about 'Confess' when it ran a review declaring, \"Lewis's ultra-confident, high-gloss sincerity is more often than not pretty hard to resist.\" Having spent the past many months touring, he recently released a brand new single titled \"To The Top\". The tune made its TV debut on June 3, 2014 during Conan O'Brien's show, gaining an enthusiastic audience response.\n\nhttp://twinshadow.net/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Twin+Shadow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
