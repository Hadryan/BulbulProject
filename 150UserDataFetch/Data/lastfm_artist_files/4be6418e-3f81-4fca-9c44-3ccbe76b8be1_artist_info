After some help with some well known Turkish composers and lyric writers, Atiye's voice began to be heard in Turkey. With the two cultures being embedded into her mind, she was able to follow a new sort of genre which binds, Turkish oriental music tunes, R&B rhythms as well as soul to evolve. With this introduction, Atiye hoped to place a twist of combination of sounds on par with other genres that could be appreciated by some fans in Turkey.\n\nDaughter of a Turkish father and a Dutch mother, Deniz was born in the city of Bremen, Germany on the 22nd of November, 1988. She went through the first half of her elementary education in Bremen and the second half in İzmir, Turkey. Later on, she would complete her secondary studies in four different nations, spending a year in each of the following nations: The USA, The Netherlands, France and finally back in Bremen. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Atiye\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
