R. Kelly's \"Remind Me\" was sampled from her \"You Remind Me,\" a popular radio-aired LP track from Straight From the Heart. Others who have sampled Rushen's music include Def Jeff (Rushen's \"Hang It Up\") Zhane (\"Groove Thang\") and a dance act called Daddy's Favourite who remade 'Haven't you heard' into a track called  \"I Feel Good Things For You\".\n\nBorn September 30,1954, in Los Angeles, CA, Rushen's parents enrolled her in music classes at U.S.C. when she was three. In her teens, she won a solo competition at the 1972 Monterey Jazz Festival. The attention garnered from this earned her a contract with Prestige Records. After recording three albums and becoming an in-demand session player, Rushen signed with Elektra Records in 1978. Forging an engaging jazz/R&B/funk fusion, she regularly hit the R&B charts. Her five albums for the label were Patrice, Pizzazz, Posh, Straight From the Heart, and Now. Some of these sides can be found on Haven't You Heard:The Best of Patrice Rushen. \n\nIn 1993, Rushen signed with Disney's Hollywood Records. Her first and only release was the excellent Anything but Ordinary, which yielded the inspiring single \"My Heart, Your Heart.\" Hollywood wasn't satisfied with the album and shelved it. Sindrome Records bought the rights to the album and reissued it with the single, and some LP tracks received airplay on R&B and smooth jazz radio stations. Rushen became a member of the jazz collective the Meeting, appearing on several releases. Her busy schedule includes session dates and being the musical director for several different tours and TV specials. 1997's Signature found Rushen returning to her jazz roots for this solid album of instrumentals. \n\nIn fall 2000, Patrice Rushen appeared as a part of Sisters Being Positively Real, an act on Brown Baby Entertainment Group.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Patrice+Rushen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
