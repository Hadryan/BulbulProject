Krell’s burgeoning career began in 2009 when, having just moved from Brooklyn to Berlin, his songs began to emerge online via a hugely prolific string of free, digital EPs posted in anonymity on his blog. Combining a gorgeous falsetto with fractured R&B-influenced beats, an instinctive ear for subtly devastating melody and elements of noise, sound collage and avant-garde composition, Love Remains offered a beautiful window into a startlingly fully realized artistic imagination. \n\nPraised for both its conceptual strength and immediate emotional resonance, Love Remains duly garnered vast critical acclaim and highlights such as “Ready for the World” and “Decisions” saw Krell accredited with having given birth to a new, narcotized strain of R&B that has since spawned a host of imitators.\n\nSince Love Remains, Krell has toured the world, recorded an EP with an orchestra (the Just Once EP, with proceeds going to raise awareness about mental illness) and, always prolific, written and recorded a lot of new music - all whilst continuing work on a philosophy doctorate. September 4th 2012 will see him share this new body of work with the world with the release of Total Loss, his new album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/How+to+Dress+Well\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
