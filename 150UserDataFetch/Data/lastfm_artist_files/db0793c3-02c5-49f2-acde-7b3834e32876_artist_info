The band consists of Anders Jacobsson (vocals, writing), Heike Langhans (vocals), Johan Ericson (guitars, writing), Jerry Torstensson (drums, percussion), Daniel Arvidsson (guitars), Fredrik Johansson (bass), and Andreas Karlsson (keyboards, programming). They produce songs with atmospheric, melodic, and emotive characteristics.\n\nIn May of 1994, drummer and vocalist Johan Ericson, bassist and vocalist Jesper Stolpe and guitarist Andy Hindenäs assembled the band Kerberos, initially playing melodic death metal with black metal influences. Seven months later, lead vocalist and lyrics composer Anders Jacobsson joined the band, and its name changed to Draconian.\n\nTheir first demo — Shades of a Lost Moon — was recorded in October 1995, a week subsequent to their first live concert. The demo counted with flutist and vocalist Jessica Eriksson, keyboardist and vocalist Susanne Arvidsson and with a special participation of Andreas Haag on the introductory section of \"My Nemesis\". The album was released in February, 1996. The band was then joined by guitatist Magnus Bergström.\n\nNo recording contract was obtained with Shades of a Lost Moon, so in early 1997 the band proceeded to record their second demo, entitled In Glorious Victory. The band, however, became discontent with the quality of the recording and discontinued the release.\n\nIn the following months, two members of Draconian had to complete their military service, slowing down the progress of the band. Their rehearsals, however, continued to some degree. Susanne Arvidsson left the band due to personal reasons and was replaced by Andreas Karlsson.\n\nBoth in 1998 and 1999, the band made concerts. After receiving positive reactions, they decided to enter the studio once more. In August of 1999, Draconian recorded The Closed Eyes of Paradise, an album dealing mostly with the theme of Lucifer and his fallen angels. Susanne Arvidsson made guest vocal appearances on this release. The album was, however, badly produced, and the band decided to spend time polishing it before a release was attempted. Between May and June of 2000, Andreas Karlsson, Anders Jacobsson, and Johan Ericson worked on the recorded material, improving the mix of the instruments and correcting effects. The demo was then released in the face of further lineup changes - Andy Hindenäs left the band, replaced by Johan Ericson who switched to guitars; drums were then left to Jerry Torstensson, who joined the band. \n\nDark Oceans We Cry was recorded in the summer of 2002 featuring the vocal talents of Lisa Johansson for the first time. The EP was made available on the internet, as well as in CD format. In spite of the recent line-up changes, the demo received outstanding reviews and the band signed a long-awaited record deal with Napalm Records.\n\nThe band recorded their debut album, Where Lovers Mourn in Studio Mega under the supervision of Chris Silver (former member of Sundown and Cemetary) in July 2003.\n\nJust two years later, under the direction of Pelle Saether, Draconian entered Studio Underground in Västerås to record Arcane Rain Fell in 2005.\n\nIn 2006 they began working on their third release. But due to myriad fan requests, the band decided to first deliver a bonus album to include remakes of old tracks from The Closed Eyes of Paradise demo. The Burning Halo would also include three new tracks and two covers. Plagued by numerous problems throughout the production phases, the album was delayed and finally completed in June and released in September 2006.\nProduced by Andreas Karlsson and Johan Ericson, and mixed in „Anders Ljudbild” by Anders Bergström, The Burning Halo is a majestic blend of Draconian's previous two releases, which shows the Swedish doom metal masters in perfect form, having developed into one of the scene's top acts.\n\nIn September 2007, Draconian started to record their 4th album Turning Season Within at the Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, with producers Jens Bogren and David Castillo (Opeth, Katatonia), who completed Draconian's vision of a extensive, weighty and dark sound. The album was released in February, 2008.\n\nTheir fifth studio album A Rose for the Apocalypse was released in June 2011 through Napalm Records.\n\nClean female vocalist  Lisa Johansson left the band in late 2011. Heike Langhans was confirmed as her replacement.\n\nOfficial site: www.draconian.se\n\n2) Draconian is a German power metal band.\n\nOfficial site: www.draconian.de\n\n3) Draconian is a Spanish band.\n\n4) Draconian was a Colombian gothic metal band formed in Medellin, Colombia. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Draconian\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
