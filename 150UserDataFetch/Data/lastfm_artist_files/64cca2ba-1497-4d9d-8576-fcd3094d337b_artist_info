For some highly erotic, for others purely asexual, Easter’s music channels the gentle embrace of crisis, like the moisturizing effects of puffy clouds against your skin as Earth’s gravitational pull beckons. \n\nEaster's first album, Ur a Great Babe (2011), was created while Stine still resided in her native Norway, taking frequent trips to Berlin to collaborate with Max. In contrast, the duo birthed its followup, The Softest Hard (2012) in close quarters, completing the record in an intense one-month process, evolving their previous no-wave leanings into something more sterile and contemporary. New Cuisine Pt. 1 (2014) revealed further development, comparatively dense with layers and textures. Their most recent effort, the Beige Eyes mixtape (2015), is a detour into Easter’s existential dreamworld of influences.\n\nEaster’s sonic identity is bolstered by a playfully clinical visual language – their  15 self-directed music videos show the sophisticated DIY aesthetic they have crafted, equally suitable for laptop screens as in white cubes. As an extension of this, in 2014, Stine and Max unveiled the first episodes of their bleak, lo-fi soap opera Sadness is an Evil Gas Inside of Me, narrated by Stones Throw recording artist Anika.\n\nAside from their studio work, Easter have taken to stages throughout Europe, going overseas for the first time in 2014 to tour North and South America. Their stoic performance has been likened more to a flesh-and-blood sound installation rather than a typical band show, embodying the unconventional yet engaging Easter ethos. \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/easterband\nhttp://easterjesus.bandcamp.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Easter\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
