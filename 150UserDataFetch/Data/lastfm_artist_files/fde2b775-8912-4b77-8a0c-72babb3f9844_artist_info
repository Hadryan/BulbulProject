A Front Line Assembly ambient side project (active from 1995 to 1997)\n2. British Progressive Rock band (active from 2012 to present)\n\n1. Synaesthesia (also known as Synæsthesia) was initially an anonymous project for Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly and Delerium to further explore their ambient ideas. The sound of Synaesthesia is basically the continuation of Delerium's ambient basis of their early albums such as \"Stone Tower\" before their gradual shift of genre towards trip-hop - the same ambient music that was released under the Delerium moniker around the time of \"Semantic Spaces.\"\n\nAll albums are credited to R. Deckard. Initially both Bill and Rhys maintained that the songs were written by him, however, by the time of the release of their third album \"Ephemeral\" it was made known that contractual agreements with other labels meant that a pseudonymous individual had to be created, and being that Bill is a big fan of Bladerunner, so why not call him R. Deckard? Leeb is now credited as main writer, with Fulber as programming & production.\n\nSynaesthesia released three albums, Embody (1994), a double CD; Desideratum (1995) and Ephemeral (1997) which was written by Leeb and Fulber, and mixed by Peterson. The compilation \"The Collection\" came out in 2001, but was marred by bad artwork and consists only of tracks available on the three studio albums.\n\n2. Synaesthesia are a British Progressive Rock band signed to GEP Records, originally a solo project by Adam Warne. Often dubbed under the label of 'Modern Prog' or 'Neo-Progressive Rock'. Their debut album, released 20th January 2014 was produced by IQ's guitarist and GEP Records CEO, Michael Holmes and engineered by Rob Aubrey. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Synaesthesia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
