Beal's first critical notice came in 2001, for his minimalist Americana score to Ed Harris' directorial debut, Pollock. He has since been nominated for eight Emmy Awards, and has won three -- one in 2007 for dramatic underscore to the TNT miniseries Nightmares and Dreamscapes Battleground episode, one in 2003 for his main theme to the USA Network detective series Monk, and the other for a documentary aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics entitled Peggy & Dorothy. Emmy nominations were awarded for his scoring work on HBO's evocative Depression-era series, Carniv√†le, and the epic drama, Rome, also on HBO. His most recent work includes the original music for ABC's hit series Ugly Betty <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Beal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
