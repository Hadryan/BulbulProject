formed in 1982\n\nOriginaly formed by Enrique Villareal \"El Drogas\" (bassist and vocalist), José (Drums), Sergio Osés (second guitar), all three coming from the band Kafarnaún, and Javier Hernandez \"Boni\" (guitarist and vocalist).\n\nThey gave their first concert in April 1982 in the Txantrea square, an even that's remembered because they played without any scenery and directly surrounded by people. (Barricada would play exactly 25 years later in the same conditions, in the same exact place reuniting numerous fans despite it was almost not advertised).\n\nMikel Astrain substituted José at the drums to record their first album \"Noche de Rock&Roll\" (1983), produced by Rosendo\n\nJust after releasing their first album Sergio had to leave the band because of the obligatory military service and Alfredo Piedrafita became the new guitarist. In 1984 Mikel died because of a stroke and Fernando Coronado became the drumer.\n\nThis formation that would stay stable until 2002 recorded the second album \"Barrio Conflictivo\" (1985). In this year they were chosen as \"Best group from Navarra\".\n\nFor their third album \"No hay tregua\" (1986) they joined the multinational RCA that tried to censor 8 of the tracks, but thanks to the strong pressure by Rosendo the album was released without changes. The band left RCA anyway.\n\nThey recorded \"No se que hacer contigo\" (1987) with the label Polygram Iberica, despite all efforts by the band the label censored the song \"Bahia de Pasaia\" that reminds the controversial murder of four members of CAA, one of them a personal friend of \"El Drogas\".\n\nThe fifth album \"Rojo\" (1988) is the personal favorite of the band\n\nThey would suffer censorship again in \"Pasion por el Ruido\" (1989) because of the song \"En nombre de Dios\", a critic to Opus Dei\n\nThe bands success kept increasing and they obtained a Golden Record award with \"Doble Directo\" (Live - 1990) and two Platinum Records for \"Por instinto\" (1991) and \"Balas blancas\" (1992). but it also meant distancing from their traditional sound and fanbase.\n\n\"La Araña\" (1994), \"Insolencia\" (1996), and Salud y \"Rock&Roll\" (Live - 1997) mark a decline in the commercial success of the band, and they finally decide to leave the label Polygram Iberica.\n\n\"Acción directa\" (2000) revisits their traditional powerful sound, yet proves the evolution of the band for joy of the original fanbase. This also means a recovery in their success.\n\nAfter \"Besame\" (2002), the last studio album up to date, Fernando leaves the band and Ibon Sagarra \"Ibi\" becomes the new drummer.\n\nSince then Barricada centres their activity in live performances.\n\nLater Releases include \"Un camino de piedras\" (2003) a tribute to Barricada by 13 well known artists and close friends. \"Latidos y mordiscos\" (2006) a double live album that includes Sax, Orchestra and a small chorus and \"25 años de rocanrol\"(2008) a compilation consisting of 2 CDs 2 DVDs and a book.\n\nThe Basque film director Juanma Bajo Ulloa, a close friend, has conducted some of their clips, and the band members appear as extras in his film Airbag\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Barricada\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
